foundational years of MSI, and the groundbreaking contract to supply black
granite for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. With every chapter, he reveals the
strategic decisions and core values that propelled MSI from a small home-based
business to a global leader in the stone and surfaces industry.

and industry evolutions, sharing insights that are as profound as they are
practical. His story is not just about building a successful company; it is about

Award (2007), Corporate Citizen of the Year Award (2022) from the City of
Orange, Top 100 Philanthropy Leaders of the Global Indian Diaspora, and the

Preface
This is a biography of Manu Shah, documenting his life
and times with his life partner Rika, and their journey in
America. Written primarily in the third person by Manu,
with the help of ChatGPT, it captures a series of stories
re ective of Manu and Rika's memories. This work has been
coordinated with Bhavik Muni,
Jasmin Sharma and
Bhavana Shah, serving as Social Impact Director, assisting
the Shah family with their philanthropic endeavors.
Manu Shah’s story is the quintessential American Dream.
Arriving in the United States in the late 1960s with a mere
$210 in his pocket and a borrowed $2,000, Manu
epitomized the spirit of relentless ambition. Graduating
with Honors from Purdue University in under a year, he
navigated the challenges of a new culture, language
barriers, and the competitive landscape of the American
job market with unparalleled determination and
adaptability to New Country.
Warren Bu et once said, "Someone's sitting in the shade
today because someone planted a tree a long time ago."
Manu’s journey embodies this sentiment. From declining a
coveted position at IBM to immersing himself in a smaller
company where he could learn every facet of the business,
Manu’s choices were always guided by a deep desire to
understand and master his environment. His early years in
America were marked by tireless e orts, working as a

ff

fl

project engineer by day and building the foundation of his
own company by night.
Together with his wife, Rika, Manu laid the groundwork
for MSI in 1975 from their modest two-bedroom home.
Rika, balancing her role as a mother and a budding
entrepreneur, worked alongside Manu to grow MSI into a
leading company. Their biggest breakthrough came with
the contract to supply black granite for the Vietnam War
Memorial in 1981—a pivotal moment that solidi ed MSI’s
place in the industry.
Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, once
noted, "In life, you have to take risks." For Manu and Rika,
the risk was monumental, but failure was never an option.
Today, MSI stands as a testament to their hard work,
employing thousands and supporting countless jobs
globally. With over 60 branches across North America and
a strong presence in India, MSI has become a beacon of
excellence in the industry, making dream surfaces
attainable for homes and o ces worldwide.
Manu never wanted to be Entrepreneur nor did know
what it means to be called “Entrepreneur”. Manu being
engineer and wanted to use Technolo y in his job, at home
or developing his wife Rika’s Export-Import business MSI.
Manu accidentally and unknowingly became Entrepreneur.
Rika’s vision for Manu must use his technical prowess in
low tech business as Natural stone for Memorial and later
for homes.
This biography captures the essence of Manu Shah’s life—
an entrepreneurial journey marked by resilience, hard

story of how one man’s vision and a family's unwavering
support turned a small business into a thriving empire. As

1.1
Foreword - From History
Reader to History Maker

s a teenager, Manu's deep fascination with history
led him to explore not only the events of the past
but their geographic contexts, often connecting them to his
growing desire to come to America. History was more than
just stories of wars and empires; it was a window into
di erent cultures, economic movements, and the evolution
o f s o c i e t i e s . M a nu’s c u r i o s i t y a n d p a s s i o n f o r
understanding the world beyond his own led him to dream
of a life in America, a place he saw as a symbol of progress
and endless possibilities.
By his twenties, Manu had transformed from a history
enthusiast into a history storyteller. His ability to relate
historical lessons to present-day situations became a
signature part of his conversations, with the refrain
"History repeats itself" often shaping his thoughts. He
became known among his peers for drawing parallels
between past events and the contemporary world, o ering
wisdom grounded in historical perspective. Manu’s skill as
a speaker blossomed during this time, and he honed it
through Toastmasters International, where he became a

ff

ff

2

respected voice in his community, known for speeches that
blended history with modern-day insights.
As the years passed and Manu entered his thirties and
forties, his engagement with history deepened further. He
began documenting his thoughts through notes and essays,
often infusing them with historical context. These writings
re ected his belief in the power of understanding the past
to guide the future. It was during this period that Manu
realized something profound: through all his e orts in
America, he wasn’t just learning history; he was making
history in his own small way. As MSI grew and ourished,
Manu understood that his journey was one that deserved to
be recorded—not just as a personal story but as part of a
broader legacy. It was time to write his own history, a story
of resilience, growth, and the power of lessons from the
past shaping a remarkable future.

n the late 1960s, a
young engineer
named Manu Shah
arrived at Purdue
U n i v e r s i t y i n We s t
Lafayette, Indiana, with
a dream to further his
education and explore
opportunities in a land
far from home. With just
$210 in his pocket and an
additional $2,000 in
borrowed money, Manu embarked on a journey that was as
daunting as it was hopeful. By 1967, America was in the
throes of the Vietnam War and the thrilling space race to
the moon. Amidst these monumental events, industries
across the nation desperately sought engineers, as many
American engineers joined defense corporations or were
swept up by NASA’s ambitious projects.
Graduating with honors in under a year from Purdue,
Manu faced a pivotal decision with three job o ers on the
table. As an immigrant in America, Manu’s challenges were
manifold—his stature was small at 5 feet 3 inches, he
weighed only 97 pounds, and he had already lost 9 pounds
due to the rigorous demands of his studies. Yet, what he
might have lacked in physical presence, he made up with a
bright mind and a relentless spirit.

Choosing not to follow a
conventional path,
Manu turned down an
o er from prestigious
IBM—a decision that
shocked his advisor at
Purdue, who remarked,
“No one says no to IBM.”
Instead, Manu opted for
a position at a smaller,
more intimate company
to learn every facet of a
business, not just the engineering side. His decision to join
a smaller company accelerated his personal growth and
learning while receiving leadership opportunities at the
very beginning of his career. Later, he joined International
Harvester as a Project Engineer.
Four years later, Manu returned to India, where he
married Rika, a teacher of math and science from Mumbai.
Together, they embarked on a new journey, settling in Fort
Wayne, Indiana. While Manu honed his skills as a project
engineer at International Harvester(Now International
Trucks), Rika was an educator having experience in
teaching high school students in India. She landed a job as
a substitute teacher in a high school in Fort Wayne;
however, things did not go as planned. She encountered
the stark di erences in educational culture and respect for
teachers between America and India. She was quite clear;
she wouldn’t continue teaching and would rather focus on
something that gave her happiness and ful llment. After
becoming a mother, Rika’s path took a new turn as she
founded MSI from their two-bedroom home. By day, she

fi

ff

ff

was a devoted mother; by night, she transformed into a
savvy businesswoman, with Manu by her side after hours.
Upon the birth of their second son, Rup, they moved into a
small house with a rather big basement – where their
business activities took place for the next 8 years – growing
kids while expanding the business.
MSI began as a modest venture, dealing initially in
integrated circuits and memory chips, but it was not long
before the business expanded into importing black granite
blocks and monuments. A pivotal moment came in 1981
when MSI secured a contract to supply black granite for the
Vietnam War Memorial. This project, fraught with risks,
was a turning point, propelling MSI towards a target of one
million dollars in revenue and prompting Manu to leave his
job to focus entirely on MSI.
Today, more than half a century later, MSI is a leading
name in the distribution of countertops, oor and wall
tiles, and outdoor hard surfaces. With over 3,000
employees across North America and an additional 750 in
India, MSI sources materials from 35 countries and
operates over 60 branches in major metropolitan areas.
The company not only beauti es homes and o ces but also
supports around 400,000 jobs in rural areas globally. Still a
family-owned enterprise with no plans to go public, MSI
stands as a testament to the enduring American dream, a
dream that Manu and Rika Shah, together with their sons
Raj and Rup, now CO CEOs, continue to build upon.
This is their American story—of dreams, struggles, and
unwavering perseverance—a narrative that underscores the

ffi

essence of what it means to chase and realize a vision
against all odds.
American Dream, especially in the context of
entrepreneurship and personal achievement, here are
several quotes by famous gures that could add depth and
inspiration:

Quotes:
Barack Obama: "The American Dream is something no
wall will ever contain."
Eleanor Roosevelt: "The future belongs to those who
believe in the beauty of their dreams."
Colin Powell: "A dream doesn't become reality through
magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work."
Henry Ford: "Whether you think you can, or you think you
can’t – you’re right."
Historical Context
1. The Vietnam War and Economic Opportunities
(1960s-1970s): Manu Shah arrived in the U.S. during a time when
the Vietnam War was creating a high demand for engineers. Many
American engineers were recruited by defense companies or NASA,
opening opportunities for immigrants like Manu to ll the gap in

and Rika’s journey of founding MSI exempli es the American
Dream, where immigrants with limited resources can build a
successful business through hard work and resilience. Their story
resonates with the core American value that anyone, regardless of
background, can achieve success if they persevere.
2. Balancing Family and Business: Rika’s role in building
MSI while raising children re ects the cultural shift in America
toward supporting women entrepreneurs. Her transition from
teaching to becoming a businesswoman highlights the adaptability
and determination required to balance family life with
entrepreneurial ambitions, a central theme in many immigrant
success stories.
3. Immigrant Contributions to U.S. Business: Immigrants
like Manu and Rika have played a crucial role in driving innovation
and creating jobs in America. MSI’s success, from importing granite

DNA of the Shah Foundation
This chapter explores the roots of Manu Shah's entrepreneurial
spirit, tracing it back to his father, Ravilal Makanji Shah. Ravilal’s
journey from Kutch, Gujarat, to Mombasa, Kenya, showcases
resilience and a commitment to community service. After moving
back to India during World War II, Ravilal’s family settled in
Mumbai, where Manu was born. Growing up in a modest home,
Manu learned lessons of perseverance, independence, and
resourcefulness, which later shaped his leadership at MSI.
Before Manu Shah's entrepreneurial journey and the success of
MSI, there was a story of resilience and determination that began
with his father, Ravilal Makanji Shah.

15

efore Manu Shah's entrepreneurial journey and the
success of MSI, there was a story of resilience and
determination that began with his father, Ravilal Makanji
Shah.

From Kutch to Mombasa: Ravilal's Early
Adventures
Ravilal Lost his Father at 14; Completed Education in
English; The year was 1918, and young Ravilal Makanji Shah,
merely 16, faced the harsh reality of life in Kutch, Gujarat—a
region scant in rainfall and opportunities. The desert
community of Kutch o ered little to its youth, prompting
many, like Ravilal, to seek fortunes
beyond the familiar horizons.
With the British Empire's
expansive reach into Africa,
opportunities beckoned young
adventurers from India to its
colonies, where white-collar jobs
were abundant compared to the
subcontinent's limited prospects.

After brief stints in Seychelles and Zanzibar, Ravilal found
his footing in Mombasa by 1920. While From Mombasa a
vibrant city in Kenya, went to Kutch and married Rambha,
a young girl from Mundra – 15 years old, in 1922, and in
Mombasa they began their family & journey amidst the

ff

16

backdrop of a bustling port city. Ravilal secured a decent
position in a shipping company, but his heart lay in serving
the wider community.
By 1933, he had helped establish a
diverse group of social workers
connected to the Jain Temple and
aiding newcomers and fostering a
spirit of unity among di erent
religions in Mombasa.

World War II and Return to Kutch

Manu, age 2

Age 8

Age 12

The onset of World War II in 1939 brought turmoil and the
threat of German advances into East Africa by 1941. The
18

British government's call to arms for all able-bodied men
under 45 meant that Ravilal had to make a monumental
decision. With eight children to consider, he and Rambha
chose to return to their native Mandvi in 1942, undertaking
a perilous 22-day boat journey amidst the ongoing war.
Choosing not to return to Africa after the war, Ravilal’s
family resettled in Mandvi where they faced numerous
challenges. It was here, in this setting of renewed
beginnings, that Manu Shah was born on June 15, 1945, as
the ninth child—a peace baby symbolizing new hopes.

A New Start in Mumbai
The post-war years saw the marriage of Manu's three
elder sisters in Kutch, while Ravilal explored new
opportunities in Mumbai. By 1951, the family moved to the
new suburb of Ghatkopar, where young Manu commenced
his educational journey, surrounded by a melting pot of
cultures and ideas in India's burgeoning metropolis.
Rambha, balancing the demands of a large family,
instilled in Manu the virtues of perseverance and optimism.
"Never give up, never cry—there will be a better tomorrow,"
she would say, a mantra that deeply in uenced Manu's
early childhood development (ECD). From his siblings,
Manu learned the value of independence, a trait echoed
through the family’s ethos.
Living in a modest 390 square foot home taught Manu
invaluable lessons in space utilization—a skill that later
proved essential in managing MSI’s expansive inventory.
Furthermore, the diverse personalities within his own

fl

19

family prepared him to
navigate the complex
interpersonal dynamics
of customers, suppliers,
and employees in his
future business
ventures.

Lessons for a Lifetime
As Manu grew, so did his responsibilities and his
understanding of the world around him. The collective
input from his family not only shaped his character but also
equipped him with the skills necessary to thrive in diverse
environments—be it in the educational pursuits in America
or the competitive business landscapes he would later
conquer.
This chapter of Manu Shah’s life provides insight into the
resilience, community service, and family values that
in uence his approach to business and life. It shows how
the challenges faced by the Shah family shaped their
journey, contributing to the growth and success of MSI and
its impact on the community today.

Manu’s Mother Rambhaben
This chapter highlights the deep in uence of Manu Shah's mother,
Rambhaben, on her family. A nurturing, resourceful woman, she
raised nine children and was known for her warmth, hospitality,
and wisdom. Rambhaben’s kitchen was a place of nourishment and
life lessons, where she taught patience, perseverance, and balance
through her cooking. Her skills as a seamstress, her frugality, and
her love for storytelling left a lasting impact on her family. Despite
lacking formal education, she was a spiritual woman, drawing
wisdom from Jainism. Her legacy of love, strength, and generosity
continues to guide her family.

Drawing parallels from her life and activities, we learned
countless lessons, both spoken and unspoken. The warm
res and aromatic dishes from her kitchen nourished not
only the body but also the soul. Feeding a battalion of
children and guests, she transformed leftovers into
mouthwatering family favorites like chhavdas, muthiyas,
moongris, musmusiyas, and thothadis. These recipes,
passed down through generations, are a testament to her
culinary genius. In Hinduism, Annapurna is the Goddess of
Food and kitchen. She ensures everyone is nourished and
that no one stays without food. Manu’s mother was a living
incarnate of Goddess Annapurna.

harmony of avors in life.
Her love was like a circle, coming back around as it went.
A gifted seamstress, she wove values and character into the
fabric of our lives. Under her deft ngers, large "thaans" of
fabric turned into clothes for all nine children, the sewing
machine whirring into the night. Embroidery, crochet, and
knitting added creativity to our daily lives, symbolizing
resilience, tenacity, strength, and generosity seamlessly
stitched into our existence.
Her frugality and thrift were elegant virtues, successfully
managing a large household while always reserving
something for charity. Her doors were never closed to
those in need. Bedtime stories and lullabies that rocked us
to sleep still ring in our ears, a comforting echo of her
nurturing presence.
Though without formal education, she was a voracious
reader, with a quest for spirituality and the essence of
Jainism, particularly "Shrimad Rajchandra." The pearls of
wisdom she shared were precious, as she lived the life she
spoke of. Her peals of laughter, whether winning or losing a
game of cards, and the innocent cheating of her
unsuspecting grandchildren, are cherished memories.
She may no longer be physically present, but a mother
never truly leaves her children's hands. She stands with us,

Early Childhood Development
This chapter emphasizes the importance of the rst six years of a
child’s life, where rapid brain development occurs, laying the
foundation for future learning, behavior, and health. For Manu
Shah, growing up in Mandvi, Kutch, his early childhood was shaped
by his large family, particularly his older siblings who nurtured his
cognitive and emotional development in the absence of formal
daycare. This supportive environment fostered adaptability and
innovation, qualities that would later contribute to Manu’s success
as an entrepreneur.
The chapter also highlights Manu's involvement with Rocket
Learning, a nonpro t focused on early childhood education for
underserved children in India. The lessons from Manu's childhood
continue to in uence his commitment to supporting quality
education and early development for children.

he rst six years of a child's life are critical for brain
development, laying the foundation for all future
learning, behavior, and health. This period is marked by
rapid growth in neural connections and cognitive abilities,
as the brain undergoes signi cant development that shape
a child's future. For Manu, growing up in the small town of
Mandvi, Kutch, in India, the early years were shaped by the
collective e orts of his large family. With his father working
in Mumbai and his mother busy managing a household of
nine children, it was his older siblings, especially his older
two sisters (Gunvantiben and Bha yavatiben), who played a
crucial role in nurturing his early development.

The Critical Role of Early Childhood
During the rst six years, a child's brain is extraordinarily
plastic, meaning it is highly responsive to environmental
stimuli and experiences. This period sees the formation of
nearly a billion neurons, each serving as a building block
for the brain's complex network of connections. Activities
like cognitive movement, color perception, shape
recognition, and motor skill development are established

g

fi

fi

ff

fi

27

during this time, laying the groundwork for more complex
skills later in life.
The human brain is a remarkable organ, characterized by
its unparalleled capacity for adaptation. From the earliest
stages of life, the brain begins a complex process of
development, orchestrating a series of changes that lay the
foundation for cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors.
Understanding early childhood brain development is
crucial for fostering environments that support optimal
growth and for mitigating the e ects of adverse conditions
that can hinder a child's potential.
In the absence of formal daycare or early education
centers, Manu's early development was supported by the
care and attention of his older siblings. Their involvement
helped foster his cognitive and emotional growth, allowing
him to develop foundational skills that would later support
his adaptability and success in life. The natural
environment of Mandvi, with its open spaces and the
freedom to explore, also contributed to his early cognitive
and physical development.

Lessons from Early Childhood Development
Manu's experiences growing up in a large family, with
older siblings who acted as mentors and caregivers,
highlight the importance of a supportive environment in
early childhood. These early interactions helped shape his
ability to adapt, learn, and innovate—qualities that would
serve him well throughout his life. The involvement of his
siblings provided a rich, interactive environment that was

ff

28

crucial for solidifying the neural connections that underpin
cognitive and physical skills.
Manu's story underscores the importance of providing
children with a nurturing environment during their
formative years. The quality of time spent by parents and
caregivers in these early years can have lasting e ects on a
child's development, in uencing their ability to learn,
adapt, and succeed later in life. As Manu would later
re ect, these early experiences set the foundation for his
lifelong journey of learning and innovation, proving that
the right environment in early childhood can indeed lead to
miraculous results.

Implications for Modern ECD Practices
The lessons from Manu's early childhood are still relevant
today, particularly in the context of modern Early
Childhood Development (ECD) practices. The science of
ECD emphasizes the need for high-quality, interactive
experiences during the rst six years of life, when the brain
is most malleable. Engaging children in activities that
stimulate cognitive and physical growth, providing proper
nutrition, and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment
are all critical components of successful ECD.
Parents, caregivers, and educators can draw on these
lessons to create environments that support the holistic
development of children. By prioritizing early childhood
education and care, society can ensure that all children can
reach their full potential, laying the groundwork for a
healthier, more innovative, and adaptable future
generation.

Readers, as you re ect on your own childhood, try to
recall memories from your earliest years. Most of us have
little to no memory of our lives before the age of four, and
only eeting glimpses of experiences between the ages of
four and six. Yet, these formative years are when some of
the most crucial brain development occurs, laying the
foundation for the person you would become. Think about
the in uences, the environment, and the interactions that
shaped you during this time—how they may have
contributed to your cognitive and emotional growth.
Now, consider the children in your life who are in this
critical age range. The actions you take—or fail to take—
during these early years will have a profound and lasting
impact on their development. Actively engaging with them,
providing enriching experiences, and nurturing their
growing minds are not just responsibilities but
opportunities to set them on a path toward lifelong success.
Missing out on this crucial developmental period can lead
to challenges that are di cult, if not impossible, to
overcome later in life. The investment you make in a child's
early brain development is one that will yield signi cant
returns, not just for them but for society.

The Brain as the Ultimate Organ of Adaptation
The brain's primary function is to process information
and orchestrate behavioral responses that enable humans
to navigate their environments. It adapts continually,
integrating sensory input with past experiences to produce
behaviors that are sometimes awe-inspiring and, at other
times, destructive. This adaptability is rooted in the brain's

fi

ffi

fl

fl

fl

30

structural and functional plasticity, which is most
pronounced during early childhood.

Historical Context of Early Childhood Brain
Development
The understanding of early childhood brain development
has evolved signi cantly over the centuries. In ancient
times, philosophers like Aristotle and Plato debated the
origins of knowledge, with some believing that children
were born as blank slates ("tabula rasa") to be shaped
entirely by experience, while others argued for innate
abilities present from birth.
It wasn't until the 18th century that scienti c inquiry into
child development began to take shape. Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, in his seminal work Émile, emphasized the
importance of early childhood education and the natural
development of children, laying the groundwork for
modern educational theory.
In the 20th century, pioneers like Maria Montessori and
Jean Piaget advanced our understanding of how children
learn and develop. Montessori's educational approach,
rooted in the belief that children learn best through handson, self-directed activities, re ected a deep respect for the
child's natural developmental processes. Jean Piaget's
theory of cognitive development, which outlined how
c h i l d r e n c o n s t r u c t k n o w l e d ge t h r o u g h s t a ge s ,
revolutionized our understanding of the mental growth
that occurs during early childhood.

fi

fl

fi

31

The latter half of the 20th century saw the advent of
neuroscience, which began to uncover the biological
underpinnings of early brain development. The
groundbreaking work of scientists such as Dr. Benjamin
Spock and Dr. T. Berry Brazelton highlighted the critical
importance of the early years in shaping a child's future,
reinforcing the idea that the experiences children have
during this period can have lasting e ects on their brain
architecture and overall development.

Neuronal Growth and Early Connectivity
At birth, a child possesses nearly one billion neurons,
each serving as a potential building block for the brain's
complex network of connections. However, these neurons
are not yet fully interconnected. Over the rst few months
of life, the brain undergoes rapid synaptogenesis, where
neurons begin forming connections through synapses,
creating intricate pathways that link the brain to various
parts of the body.
These neural connec tions are critic al for the
development of physical and cognitive functions. For
example, a seemingly simple action such as turning the
head toward a light or sound source involves a complex
interplay of neural signals between the eyes, ears, neck
muscles, and the brain. Once an action is successfully
executed, the brain retains this connection, reinforcing the
neural pathway and making future similar actions more
e cient. This process of trial, error, and retention is
foundational for all future learning and development.

32

The Critical First Six Years
The rst six years of life are especially crucial for brain
development, as this period sees the most rapid and
signi cant growth in neural connections and cognitive
abilities. During this time, foundational activities such as
cognitive movement, color perception, shape recognition,
and motor skills development are established. These
activities are not isolated; they are deeply interconnected
with the synchronization of the body's physical parts,
including the eyes, ears, hands, feet, tongue, teeth, and
muscles.
As the brain and body work together to master basic
functions, these early years lay the groundwork for more
complex cognitive and physical skills that will be built upon
throughout life. This is why the quality of time spent by
parents and caregivers during early childhood is so critical.
Engaging children in rich, interactive experiences helps to
solidify these neural connections, leading to what can often
be described as miraculous results in a child's
development.

Work remains to see role of DNA, ECD and
challenging Circumstances - which has what kind of
in uence in the life of a leader?

Early Childhood Chapter: The Role of DNA,
ECD, and Challenging Circumstances in
Leadership Development
The journey of leadership often begins long before one
assumes a formal title. It is shaped by a complex interplay
of genetic factors (DNA), early childhood development
(ECD), and the challenging circumstances that forge
resilience and adaptability. These elements combine to
create a foundation upon which future leaders build their
skills, perspectives, and values.

The Role of DNA
DNA provides the raw material for potential—intelligence,
temperament, and natural inclinations are all in uenced by
genetic inheritance. However, DNA is only part of the story.
It sets the stage but does not determine the entire play.
Leadership qualities like curiosity, persistence, and the
ability to empathize with others can be in uenced by
genetic predispositions, yet they must be nurtured and
developed through experiences and education.developed
through experiences and education.
Early Childhood Development (ECD)
The rst six years of life are critical in shaping a child's
cognitive, emotional, and social abilities. High-quality ECD,
which includes proper nutrition, stimulating environments,
and supportive relationships, can signi cantly in uence a
child's potential for leadership. For Manu Shah, growing up
in a small city like Mandvi with the support of his older
siblings and minimal formal daycare options, the informal
learning and constant engagement with family members
played a crucial role in his cognitive development. This
early foundation set the stage for his ability to adapt,
innovate, and lead e ectively later in life.
Challenging Circumstances
Leadership is often homed in the crucible of adversity.
Challenging circumstances push individuals beyond their
comfort zones, forcing them to develop problem-solving
skills, resilience, and the ability to navigate uncertainty. For

Manu, the challenges of growing up in a large family, with
the added complexity of his father's absence due to work in
Mumbai, meant that he had to quickly learn to be selfreliant and resourceful. These early experiences of
managing life's di culties without the immediate presence
of a parental gure instilled in him the resilience and
adaptability that would later de ne his leadership style at
MSI.
Context and Quotes
T h e i n te r p l ay o f D NA , E C D, a n d c h a l l e n g i n g
circumstances can be likened to the words of Warren
Bennis: "The most dangerous leadership myth is that
leaders are born—that there is a genetic factor to
leadership. This myth asserts that people simply
either have certain charismatic qualities or not. That's
nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are
made rather than born."
Maria Montessori: "The greatness of the human
personality begins at the hour of birth. From this almost
mystic a rmation there comes what may seem a strange
conclusion—that education must start from birth."
Dr. Benjamin Spock: "Trust yourself. You know more than
you think you do."
Jean Piaget: "The principal goal of education in the schools
should be creating men and women who are capable of
doing new things, not simply repeating what other

Story of Resilience and Grit
This chapter recounts Manu Shah's early life in India, shaped by
economic hardships, political instability, and a strong family
foundation. Growing up in Kutch during challenging times, Manu
witnessed resilience and determination from his mother and
grandmothers. The food crisis of the 1950s, aided by the PL 480
program, left a lasting impact on his childhood. Despite these
struggles, Manu's passion for science and education grew, with the
support of his family. Inspired by opportunities in America and
driven by the encouragement of his brother, Manu pursued his
dream of studying in the United States, ultimately enrolling at
Purdue University.

41

rowing up in Mandvi, Manu was surrounded by the
strength and resilience of the women in his family.
His mother, a petite yet formidable gure, embodied
optimism and perseverance. "No matter how tough times
are, better days are always
ahead," she would often
say. His grandmothers,
from both sides remained a
constant presence in his
early life further reinforced
these values. The in uence
of these strong women
would shape Manu's
outlook on life and instill in
him an unyielding
determination to succeed.

Economic Hardships and the PL 480 Program
The late 1950s in India were marked by severe economic
hardships. The country's food crisis left an indelible mark
on Manu's childhood. In 1958, India's wheat crop slumped
by 15%, and the rice harvest was down by 12%, causing
market prices to soar. This situation was dire, with
widespread hunger and long lines for food supplies.
The United States stepped in with the PL 480 program,
o cially known as the Agricultural Trade Development and
Assistance Act of 1954. This program aimed to provide food
aid to developing countries, including India. The PL 480
program brought coarse red wheat, initially meant for
livestock, to India's hungry population.

fi

fl

ffi

42

Manu vividly recalls the hours spent waiting in line for
this wheat, which became a staple in the Shah household.
"We were told it was meant for American pigs, but back
then, we didn’t have an option.” Manu would later re ect.
Despite the coarse texture and unfamiliar taste, the wheat
and other food supplies like powdered milk and vegetable
oil were lifelines for lower middle-class Indian families
during this period of scarcity. Rika had her share of waiting
in line at age10 11 in Matunga, a suburb of Mumbai.

Sparking a Passion for Science
In 1959, Manu's school received a scholarship of 2000
rupees to start a science club (pre-STEM). To put this into
perspective, 2000 rupees in the late 1950s would be
roughly equivalent to about $400 at that time, a scanty
amount for a school of 2000 students in a suburb of
Mumbai. Though only in the ninth grade, Manu was
determined to join. Manu built a working telegraph,
impressing his teacher and earning a place in the club as its
youngest member. This experience not only fueled his
passion for science but also ignited his dream of going to
America—a land that seemed full of possibilities.

The Importance of Education
Education was highly valued in the Shah family. Manu's
father, despite having limited formal education, learned
English while working in Mombasa and became pro cient.
Manu's siblings, particularly his second sister, played a
signi cant role in his early education. By the age of four,

fl

fi

fi

43

Manu could recite multiplication tables of up to 20, a skill
that set him apart from his peers. However, he often felt
small and undernourished compared to others, which
impacted his self-esteem. Till date he is one of the best to
work with numbers out of 3000+ employees in MSI except
his two sons – Raj & Rup.
Manu's commitment to education was further solidi ed
by his family's belief in its transformative power. "Education
was the only way out," Manu recalls. "We didn't have
money, but we had ambition and the drive to learn."

Adolescence and Political Instability
Adolescence brought its own set of challenges. India's
political and economic instability, exacerbated by the 1962
war with China and the 1965 war with Pakistan, made the
future seem uncertain. Nehru's socialist policies, aimed at
industrializing the nation and reducing poverty, often fell
short of their ambitious goals. The First Five-Year Plan,
launched in 1951, focused on agrarian reform and
industrialization, but its mixed results led to widespread
frustration.
The 1962 Sino-Indian War, which ended in a humiliating
defeat for India, further strained the nation's resources and
morale. "We were misled to believe that India was not in
such bad shape," Manu recalls. "It wasn't until much later
that we realized how badly we had lost to China." The
subsequent war with Pakistan in 1965, while not as
disastrous, also failed to yield a decisive victory, further
compounding the nation's woes.

fi

44

These circumstances made Manu realize that for a better
future, he needed to look beyond India's borders. Inspired
by the tales of opportunity and the grandeur of the Statue
of Liberty, Manu began seriously considering the possibility
of moving to America. His brother, a constant source of
support and guidance, encouraged him to apply to
universities in the United States. Despite the nancial
hurdles, Manu was determined to make this dream a
reality.

Dreaming of America
In 1965, Manu's dream of America was fueled by the
inspirational gure of President John F. Kennedy, whose
assassination in 1963 had deeply a ected many young
Indians. "President Kennedy was very popular among the
youth in India," Manu re ects. "His vision and charisma
made us believe in the possibility of a better future." The
image of the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building,
and the promise of endless opportunities drove Manu to
pursue higher education in the United States.
His eldest brother Yashwant, who had always been a
guiding force in his life, urged him to pursue higher
education in America. With nancial help from his brother
and a loan from his hostel donor, Manu came to the United
States of America. He got admission to the prestigious
Purdue University — a decision that would change his life.
He chose Purdue among other universities such as UC
Berkeley was in uenced by Purdue’s reputation for
excellence in engineering and its relatively low cost.

The In uence of Family Dynamics
Growing up in a large family, Manu learned the
importance of resilience and adaptability from an early age.
"Being the youngest of nine siblings taught me a lot about
survival and independence," he recalls. "You had to nd
your own way and make your voice heard."
Manu's father, a respected gure in the community, had
instilled in his children the values of hard work and
perseverance. "My father was a visionary," Manu says. "He
always believed in the power of education and the
importance of giving back to society."

Early Lessons in Philanthropy
The science club scholarship that Manu received in 1959
had a profound impact on him. "That scholarship opened
my eyes to the power of giving," he re ects. "Someone
somewhere had donated that money without knowing who
would bene t from it. That inspired me to think about how
I could give back in the future to unknowns."
Manu's early experiences with philanthropy would shape
his approach to business and life. "I've always believed in
helping those in need, even if I don't know them
personally," he says. "It's about making a di erence, no
matter how small or big."

Navigating Childhood Challenges
Manu's childhood was not without its hardships. He
su ered from anemia; a condition exacerbated by the
scarcity of nutritious food. "In sixth grade, I weighed only
46 pounds," he recalls. "I was always tired and weak, but I
never let it stop me from pursuing my dreams."
Despite these challenges, Manu remained determined to
succeed. "I knew that education was my ticket to a better
life," he says. "I was willing to work hard and make
sacri ces to achieve my goals."

Quotes:
Helen Keller: "Although the world is full of su ering, it is
also full of the overcoming of it."

Leaving for America And
Life in Purdue
This chapter covers Manu Shah's decision to leave India for better
opportunities in America due to economic instability and lack of
prospects for engineers in the late 1960s. Upon arriving at Purdue
University, Manu faced language barriers, cultural adaptation, and
nancial challenges but remained resilient. His ability to manage
time, practice for interviews, and strategically choose his career
path set the foundation for his future success. Graduating with
honors in less than a year, Manu turned down a prestigious o er
from IBM to work for a smaller company where he could gain a
more diverse business experience.

Leaving for America Goodbye to Parents

"Things were failing in India," Manu recalls. "Jawaharlal
Nehru's socialist policies were not yielding the desired
results. The wars with China in 1962 and Pakistan in 1965
further strained the nation. There was no future for young
engineers like me. It was better to get out and seek
opportunities elsewhere, not just for myself but for my
family."

Early days
""America is a land of opportunity, but it is also a land of
challenges," Manu says. During his initial days struggled
with the English language, at the same time adapting to a
di erent culture in a new environment. His rst week at
Purdue was particularly di cult. "I had to pass the Test of
English as a Foreign Language exam, and I unked it on my
seventh day," Manu recalls. "I almost cried when my advisor

fi

fl

told me I would need an extra semester, which I couldn't
a ord."
Desperate, Manu requested another chance and studied
intensively. "Those three days were the hardest," he says,
"but I passed the exam on my second attempt." This
experience marked the beginning of Manu's resilience in
America. It was a testament to his ability to adapt and
persevere under pressure.

Historical Context: 1967 America and Life at
Purdue University
In 1967, America was in the midst of signi cant social and
political upheaval. The Vietnam War was escalating,
sparking widespread protests and a burgeoning anti-war
movement. The Civil Rights Movement was gaining
momentum, pushing for racial equality and justice across
the nation. Cultural shifts were also underway, with the
counterculture movement challenging traditional norms
and advocating for peace, love, and freedom. Amidst this
backdrop, Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana,
was a hub of academic excellence and innovation. Known
for its strong engineering programs, Purdue attracted
students from around the world. Life at Purdue in 1967 was
a mix of rigorous academic pursuits and active campus life.
Students engaged in cutting-edge research, participated in
diverse extracurricular activities, and were part of a
community that was both intellectually stimulating and
socially vibrant. For international students like Manu Shah,

Adapting and Thriving

Manu at Purdue

At Purdue, Manu quickly
realized the importance of time
management. He bought a
bicycle to save commuting time
and took on a job as a student
assistant, earning $1.25 per
hour. His professor, impressed
by Manu's dedication, allowed
him to work extra hours,
providing much-needed
nancial support.

"Buying that bicycle was a game-changer," Manu notes. "It
saved me almost an hour every day, time I used to work
and study more e ectively." This foresight and practicality
became a hallmark of Manu's approach to challenges.
One of the most valuable lessons Manu learned during
his time at Purdue was the importance of practice and
preparation. He attended job interviews with American
Corporation looking for Engineers in his rst semester in
USA! Not with the intention of securing a job but to
understand the types of questions asked and to improve his
responses. "I wasn't looking for a job; I was looking to
learn," Manu explains. "I practiced with every interview,
getting better each time."

studies while navigating the broader cultural and political
currents of a transformative era in American history.

By the end of his second semester, Manu had three job
o ers. "Almost all foreign students from India or any other
country hardly got job o ers because they were still
learning how to answer the questions. I had practiced and
was ready," he says.

Making Strategic Choices
Graduating with Honors in under a year, Manu weighed
his options carefully. Manu was one of the select candidates
at Purdue to receive an o er from IBM, one of the top
corporations in America. However, Manu’s goal was to not
just be a specialist doing one thing in a big company.
Instead he wanted to learn di erent facets of the business
and hone his skills across functions. Hence decided to join
a smaller company - Ohio Brass Company. This decision
was brave, and forward-looking.
"Everyone thought I was crazy for turning down IBM,"
Manu admits. "But I wanted to learn everything about

ff

ff

ff

ff

53

business, not just be a cog in a giant machine. Ohio Brass
was a smaller company where I could see the impact of my
work and learn across di erent functions."

Learning Through Challenges
Manu's early years in America were challenging but
rewarding. He lost weight due to the rigorous demands of
his studies and work, but he gained invaluable experience
and knowledge. Manu practiced what he had learned,
whether in job interviews or practical engineering projects,
and constantly sought to improve.
"My weight dropped from 105 pounds to 96 pounds,"
Manu recalls. "It was tough, but it didn't bother me. I was
focused on my goals." This period of intense e ort and
learning laid the foundation for Manu's future success.

The Space Race and the American Spirit

ff

ff

54

During Manu's time at Purdue, the United States was in
edging in the Space Race with the Soviet Union. The drive
to put man on the moon fueled national pride and
technological advancements. Manu was inspired by the
determination and ingenuity of NASA and its astronauts,
many of whom were trained at Purdue. "Neil Armstrong
walked these very halls," Manu would often remind
himself, drawing motivation from the footsteps of those
who aimed for the stars.
"The Space Race was everywhere," Manu re ects. "It was
a time of immense pride and ambition in America.
Knowing that I was studying at the same place as Neil
Armstrong and other NASA astronauts was incredibly
motivating. It made me feel like anything was possible."

Financial Struggles and Practical Lessons
Manu's nancial struggles continued throughout his time
at Purdue. He took on various jobs to support himself,
including working in the university library and doing odd
jobs for professors. "Every penny counted," he says. "I
learned to be frugal and make the most of every
opportunity."
One of the practical lessons Manu learned was the
importance of networking. "I attended every seminar, every
networking event I could nd," he recalls. "I knew that
building relationships was key to nding opportunities."
This proactive approach helped Manu secure his rst job
o ers and laid the groundwork for his future business
ventures.

The Importance of Family and Community
Despite being thousands of miles away from home, Manu
remained closely connected to his family. "Letters from
home were my lifeline," he says. "My family's support kept
me going, even during the toughest times." Manu also
found a sense of community among fellow international
students at Purdue. "We were all in the same boat, facing
similar challenges. We supported each other and celebrated
each other's success."

The Beginning of a New Chapter
Graduating from Purdue with honors was a proud
moment for Manu. "It was the culmination of all my hard
work and sacri ces," he says. But it was also just the
beginning. Manu's journey from born in a small town in
India to growing up in Mumbai to one of the most
prestigious engineering universities in America was lled
with challenges, but it also paved the way for the
entrepreneurial ventures that would follow.

A Wa r t i m e We d d i n g Beginning of a Lifelong
Journey
This chapter details the story of Manu and Rika Shah’s rapid
engagement and wedding during the turbulent time of the 1971 IndoPakistani War. Despite the chaos of war and blackouts in Mumbai,
their families arranged a simple wedding on December 12, 1971, with
about 150 guests. Just 45 days after the wedding, the couple moved
to America to start their new life. Over the next 52 years, Manu and
Rika built a life lled with love, challenges, and shared
accomplishments, with their bond rooted in mutual respect and
understanding.

fi

58

ecember 1971
was
a
challenging period for
India. The country
was in the midst of
the Bangladesh
Liberation War, with
millions of refugees
pouring into India
from East Pakistan
(now Bangladesh) and
an imminent war with West Pakistan. Amidst this national
turmoil, Manu Shah’s family decided it was the perfect time
for him to get married. This decision was steeped in
tradition and necessity, re ecting characteristic of Indian
families.

The Arranged Meeting and Rapid Engagement
Manu, having recently graduated from the prestigious
VJTI College in Matunga, Mumbai, was looking for a life
partner. His family had known Rika’s family for a long time,
both coming from large middle-class backgrounds in the
Kutch region. Although they had never met, their families
were convinced that Manu and Rika were a perfect match.
Rika, living in the same suburb where Manu had studied,
was also looking for someone settled in the USA. Her family
wanted her to marry a man who could provide stability and
opportunity. Manu’s family, on the other hand, sought a
companion and partner for Manu who would also be a
nurturing mother to his future children.

fl

59

The families arranged for Manu and Rika to meet on
November 28, 1971. After just ve days of getting to know
each other, they decided to get engaged on December 2.
This brief courtship was typical of the time, especially in
arranged marriages, where family connections and mutual
respect were paramount.

Historical Context: The 1971 Indo-Pakistani
War and the Birth of Bangladesh
The 1971 Indo-Pakistani War was a major con ict that led
to the creation of Bangladesh. The roots of this war lay in
the political and social tensions between East Pakistan
(now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (now Pakistan). East
Pakistan sought independence due to cultural, linguistic,
and political discrimination by the ruling West Pakistani
regime. The con ict escalated into a full-scale war in
December 1971 when India intervened in support of East
Pakistan after millions of refugees ed to India to escape
the brutal military crackdown by West Pakistani forces. The
war resulted in a decisive victory for India, leading to the
surrender of Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and the
establishment of Bangladesh as an independent nation on
December 16, 1971. This war not only reshaped the
geopolitical landscape of South Asia but also highlighted
the enduring struggle for self-determination and human
rights.

The Wedding: A Simple A air in a Time of War
The wedding date was set
for December 12, 1971.
During these ten days,
Manu and Rika spent a
few hours together each
day, getting to know each
other better. The wedding
took place amidst the war
with Pakistan, which led
to blackouts in Mumbai
and a city on high alert.
Despite these challenging
circumstances, the
wedding went ahead as
planned.
Given the wartime situation, only about 150 people could
attend the wedding ceremony and reception. By 5 PM,
everyone had left, and the newlyweds were left to start
their journey together. Manu’s parents were happy, and
despite the simplicity of the ceremony, it marked the
beginning of a remarkable partnership.

Starting a New Life in America
Just 45 days after their wedding, Manu and Rika left for
America. This was a signi cant transition, especially for
Rika, who had to adapt to a new country, culture, and
lifestyle. Their early days in America were lled with

creating a life lled with love, challenges, and
accomplishments. They often re ect on their rapid
engagement and wartime wedding, sharing stories of their
unique journey with friends and family. People frequently
ask them about the secret to their successful marriage.
Their response is simple: there is no secret. Their bond is
built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared
experiences that have shaped their lives.

Re ections and Lessons Learned
The story of Manu and Rika’s marriage is a testament to
the power of commitment and adaptability. Despite the
uncertainties of war and the rapid pace of their courtship
and wedding, they embraced their journey together with
open hearts and minds. Their experiences have taught

Rika's Mother Chanduben
Chanduben, a ectionately called "Ba," was a beloved maternal
gure who brought the traditions and simplicity of Jainism into the
lives of her family. Her daily routines, such as early meals and a
simple, disciplined lifestyle, kept her healthy and peaceful. Ba
quietly in uenced her grandchildren, teaching them the values of
Gujarati culture and Jain practices. She lived with the family in
Southern California for nearly 20 years, becoming a source of
comfort and blessings for many in the community. Her legacy lives

The Legacy of Shree
Gangjibhai Parekh - A Man
of Principle and Resilience
Shree Gangjibhai Parekh, Rika Shah's father, was a man of
resilience, strong principles, and unwavering dedication to his
family and community. Born in 1893 in Kutch Mundra, India,
Gangjibhai overcame early life hardships, including losing his
parents and surviving the devastating plague. After moving to
Mumbai for work, he became a trusted gure in his business and
was known for his generosity, community service, and strong Jain
faith. He was deeply respected for his meticulous nature, negotiating
skills, and commitment to providing his children with a good
education. His legacy of integrity and compassion continues to
inspire his descendants.

ika Shah’s
f a t h e r, S h re e
Gangjibhai Parekh, was
a man whose life
e x e m p l i
e d
perseverance, principle,
and strong values
despite numerous
adversities. Born in 1893
in Kutch Mundra, India,
Gangjibhai faced
immense challenges
from a young age.
Orphaned early in life, he grew up amid the devastating
plague that swept through India between 1896 and 1921,
claiming millions of lives. Despite losing many relatives and
friends to the disease, Gangjibhai survived and would go on
to live a life lled with wisdom, integrity, and unwavering
dedication to his family and community.
In 1929, Gangjibhai married Chanduben, who had also lost
her parents at a young age. Together, they built a family
and a life in Kutch Mundra, where their rst daughter,
Dahiben, was born in 1932. Soon after, Gangjibhai
employer, Kalyanji Dhanji & Co., transferred him to their
new o ce in Bombay (now Mumbai). Tasked with growing
the business in this bustling metropolis, Gangjibhai worked
diligently, proving himself to be not just a capable
businessman but a trustworthy and reliable asset to his

fi

fi

fi

ffi

company. His employers placed complete trust in him,
never questioning his work or decisions.
In 1939, Gangjibhai moved his family to Matunga, a suburb
of Bombay, where they would grow to include four sons
and four daughters. Known a ectionately as “Bhai” by his
children, he was a man of great principle. His attire
remained constant throughout his life—he wore a
traditional jabho with a long jacket, dhoti, and black topi
(hat), and in his later years, carried an umbrella, which he
used for support instead of a cane.
Gangjibhai was a man deeply connected to his community.
He believed in sharing and giving back, especially when it
came to food. Every morning, he would feed the street
dogs with rotla and o er grains to pigeons, believing that
caring for animals was a noble and necessary act. His
meticulous nature extended to every aspect of his life,
especially food. He personally inspected raw materials and
ensured that everything purchased for the home was of the
highest quality. His focus on pure, clean, and healthy food
earned him great respect in the community. When food
was shared by him, it was known to be perfect in weight,
price, and quality, and he often asked family members to
distribute it at cost price to others.
One of Gangjibhai’s most enduring traits was his
exceptional negotiating ability. He became known for his
famous tactic of intentionally leaving his umbrella behind
when a negotiation was not going well. This clever strate y
allowed him to return to the client’s o ce under the
pretense of retrieving his umbrella and restart negotiations
with fresh ener y, often leading to a successful outcome.

His children would later recall this lesson as a profound
business strate y—always keep the door open for a second
chance.
Gangjibhai’ s commitment to his Jain faith was equally
remarkable. He strictly followed the practice of Choviyar,
refraining from eating after sunset. If he arrived home late
from work and missed sunset, he would skip dinner
altogether, a testament to his discipline and devotion. His
belief in living a simple and disciplined life extended to his
interactions with others, earning him a reputation for being
wise and thoughtful. Many in the community sought his
advice, and despite having a limited budget, Gangjibhai
ensured that all his children received a good education,
something he believed was critical to their success.
Shree Gangjibhai Parekh’s legacy is one of resilience,
wisdom, and profound integrity. He was a man who not
only overcame the adversities of his early life but used
those experiences to shape his character and guide his
family with strong moral values. His principles of trust,
fairness, and discipline left an indelible mark on those
around him and continue to in uence the lives of his
descendants. His life stands as a testament to the power of
living with purpose, integrity, and compassion, and his
story serves as an enduring inspiration to his family and
community.

Sheth to Shah & Parekh
DNA
This chapter delves into the rich history of the Sheth, Shah, and
Parekh surnames, exploring their deep roots in India’s mercantile
and trading traditions. The name "Shah" is tied to business
leadership, especially in Jain and Vaishya communities, while
"Sheth" historically symbolized wealth and social prominence. The
Parekh surname is associated with expertise in precious metals.
Each name re ects a legacy of ethical business practices,
community leadership, and philanthropy.

Shah: Origins, Evolution, and In uence
The surname Shah is one of the most recognizable names
in the Indian subcontinent, especially within business and
nance sectors. The word originates from the Persian
"Shah," which historically referred to a king or emperor.
However, in the Indian context, the title evolved to signify
leadership in the business world, especially among the Jain
and Vaishya communities
1. Historical Context
• Origins in Persia: The word Shah came into India
during the rule of Persian and Mughal empires. While
Shah was originally a title for royalty and rulers, over
time, it was adopted by in uential traders and
merchants, particularly those of Jain and Hindu
communities, especially in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and
Maharashtra.
• Merchant Class: The adoption of Shah by Jain and
Vaishya families represented leadership in trade and
commerce. Gujarat, known for its vibrant trading culture,
became a hub for merchant communities, and many
successful traders adopted the title as a mark of their

he history of the surnames Sheth, Shah and
Parekh in India is quite rich, and both are tied
deeply to India’s mercantile and trading traditions, as well
as their association with various social and religious
communities.

economic power and prestige.
• Economic Leadership: Shahs were known for their
role as nancial leaders in local economies, often acting
as bankers, nanciers, and large-scale traders. The
surname symbolized success, ethics, and responsibility
in business dealings, and it became synonymous with
trust and respect within business circles.
2. Association with Jainism
• Jain Ethos of Trade: Jainism’s principles of nonviolence (ahimsa) and truth (satya) played a crucial role
in shaping the moral compass of the Shah families. This
ethical foundation helped them build business empires
that were known not just for their wealth, but for their
integrity and philanthropy.
• Philanthropy and Social Responsibility: Shahs are
often associated with large donations to religious and
educational causes. Jain businessmen like Virchand
Gandhi, a prominent Jain scholar, and other in uential
Shahs contributed greatly to the development of
charitable institutions, temples, and educational
establishments in India and abroad.
3. Modern In uence
• Diaspora: As India opened up to global trade, many
Shah families expanded their businesses to international
markets, particularly East Africa, the UK, and the USA.
Shah communities now ourish in countries with
signi cant Indian diasporas, continuing their legacy as

• Leadership in Industry: Today, many Shahs occupy
leadership positions in industries such as nance, real
estate, technolo y, and hospitality. Their reputation for
business acumen and ethical trading practices continues
to uphold the legacy of their ancestors.

The Sheth Surname: Historical Signi cance
and Evolution
The surname Sheth (sometimes spelled as Seth, Sethia,
or Seth) has deep historical roots in India, particularly
within the trading and merchant communities of Gujarat,
Rajasthan, and other northern parts of India. The term
Sheth historically signi ed a person of great wealth,
property, and in uence, often a landowner, banker, or
merchant. It carried an air of prestige, connoting not just
nancial success but also social prominence and leadership
within the community.
1. Meaning and Origins
• Historical Role: In its most traditional sense, the word
Sheth is derived from the Sanskrit "Shreshta," meaning
excellent or eminent. In this context, a Sheth was
considered the head of a large mercantile establishment,
usually a person with signi cant property holdings and
in uence in commerce. Historically, Sheths were often
nanciers or bankers who controlled large sums of
money and owned substantial assets.

business leaders in new territories.

• Landowners and Merchants: In ancient and
medieval India, Sheths often owned vast tracts of land
and managed extensive trading networks. They provided
loans to traders, funded large-scale construction
projects, and invested in various enterprises. In many
cases, they were in uential gures in both local
economies and political spheres.
2. Social Status
• Symbol of Wealth and Power: The Sheth surname
was associated with power, in uence, and wealth. Those
who carried the name were generally seen as part of the
upper echelons of society. In many cases, the Sheth
family would be responsible for supporting temples,
schools, and charities, further solidifying their standing
as pillars of the community.
• Prestige and Exclusivity: Given the connotations of
great wealth and property ownership, the Sheth surname
became synonymous with an elite class of people. It
conveyed a sense of exclusivity and entitlement,
signaling that those with the Sheth surname were among
the most a uent in society.
3. Change from Sheth to Shah
• Shedding the Elite Identit y: Manu's great
grandfather made a conscious decision to change the
family name from Sheth to Shah. This shift was signi cant
as it marked a departure from an elite and somewhat
exclusive identity to a more common and egalitarian one.
The Shah surname, associated with business, accounting,

fi

fi

fl

fl

ffl

75

• Association with Accounting and Clerical Work:
The decision to adopt the Shah surname may also have
been motivated by a desire to align the family’s identity
with accounting, clerical, and business-related
professions, which were respected but not as exclusive as
landowning or banking. The Shah name was widespread
among professionals involved in trade, accounting, and
nance, symbolizing diligence, hard work, and a strong
moral compass.
4. Practical Reasons for the Change
• Embracing Simplicity: By changing the surname
from Sheth to Shah, Manu’s great grandfather was
embracing a more practical and approachable identity.
The change re ected a desire to be seen as part of the
burgeoning professional classes rather than as part of an
exclusive upper class. This shift allowed the family to
connect with a broader range of people in business,
clerical work, and trade.
• Social Mobility: Changing the name to Shah may have
also re ected the family’s understanding of the shifting
dynamics of Indian society, where professional skills and
business acumen were becoming more valued than
hereditary titles or land ownership. The Shah name
allowed the family to be part of the growing white-collar
workforce, which was gaining prominence during India’s
colonial and post-colonial periods

fl

76
fl

fi

and white-collar work, allowed the family to blend into
the broader community, embracing a humbler and more
accessible persona.

Conclusion: The Legacy of Sheth and Shah
The decision to change the family surname from Sheth to
Shah represented more than just a simple name change; it
signi ed a shift in identity, values, and social outlook.
While the Sheth surname was historically associated with
great wealth, power, and exclusivity, the Shah name
allowed the family to embrace a more modest, yet equally
respected, professional identity.
By adopting the Shah name, Manu's great grandfather
aligned the family with the hardworking, ethical, and
intellectually driven communities of traders, accountants,
and professionals. This change likely contributed to the
family’s success in business, including their legacy in trade,
commerce, and nance, which continues today.
The journey from Sheth to Shah illustrates how names
carry not only personal history but also social, cultural, and
professional signi cance, and how adapting to changing
times can help ensure long-term success and relevance in a
shifting world.

Parekh: Assayers, Merchants, and Cultural
Custodians
The surname Parekh has an equally distinguished
history, particularly connected to the trade of precious
metals and money lending. The word "Parekh" comes from
the Sanskrit "Pariksha," which means examiner, re ecting

fl

fi

fi

fi

77

1. Historical Context
• Goldsmiths and Assayers: The Parekh surname is
traditionally associated with goldsmiths, jewelers, and
nanciers who had the responsibility of testing and verifying
the purity of metals. This work required a high level of skill,
trustworthiness, and integrity, as the results directly impacted
the value of trade goods.
• Guilds and Merchant Associations: The Parekh families
were often part of merchant guilds, where they were entrusted
with responsibilities that required a reputation for fairness and
precision. Their knowledge of metals, gems, and nance made
them key gures in local and international trade, particularly
in Gujarat and Rajasthan.
2. Role in Jain and Vaishya Communities
• Jain Values: Like the Shah families, many Parekhs are part
of the Jain community. Jain values of non-violence, truth, and
charity were re ected in their business practices. Many Parekh
families were not only successful in trade but also in social
service, contributing to the construction of Jain temples and
educational institutions.
• Vaishya In uence: In Hindu society, the Parekhs were part
of the Vaishya caste, traditionally responsible for trade and
commerce. This caste distinction reinforced their role in the
economic systems of ancient and medieval India, particularly
in cities like Surat, Ahmedabad, and other trade centers of
Gujarat.

the expertise of the Parekh families in assaying the purity of
gold, silver, and other precious materials.

3. Cultural Impact
• Trust and Expertise: The Parekh surname became a
symbol of trust in nancial dealings. When merchants engaged
in trade, the assurance of a Parekh overseeing the transaction
brought con dence that the metals and money involved were
handled ethically.
• Philanthropy and Charity: Many Parekhs have followed
the tradition of giving back to their communities. Over the
years, they have funded the construction of hospitals, schools,
and other community development projects.
4. Migration and Modern Times
• Spread of Parekhs: Like the Shahs, many Parekh families
migrated across India and eventually abroad, establishing
themselves in East Africa, the UK, and the USA. They have
carried their legacy of business expertise and philanthropy
into these new environments.
• Contemporary Success: Today, Parekhs are successful not
just in gold and jewelry but also in a range of industries,
including real estate, nance, technolo y, and education. They
continue to uphold the values of accuracy, trust, and integrity
in their modern-day endeavors.

Conclusion: The Legacy of Shah and Parekh
Surnames
Both the Shah and Parekh surnames represent centuries
of tradition, ethical business practices, and leadership
within Indian society. Rooted in trade, nance, and
community, these names are not just markers of individual
families but symbols of the values of entire communities.
Whether in Gujarat, Rajasthan, or abroad, Shah and Parekh
families have played an integral role in shaping the social,
economic, and cultural fabric of their environments. Their
contributions to philanthropy, business ethics, and social
responsibility continue to resonate across generations.

From Mumbai to Cleveland The Early Journey of Rika
Shah
This chapter recounts Rika Shah’s journey from Mumbai to
Cleveland, highlighting her determination to pursue higher
education and her dream of moving to America. Despite societal
expectations, Rika earned a Bachelor of Science in Botany and
Chemistry, with her eldest brother's support. Her move to Cleveland
after marrying Manu Shah in 1972 presented challenges, including
adjusting to a new culture, cold weather, and starting a family in a
foreign land. Rika's entrepreneurial spirit emerged as she balanced
her professional aspirations with family responsibilities, using her
experiences to shape her path to success.

81

ika’s education journey began at Matunga Premier
School in Mumbai, where her favorite subjects
were Science and Mathematics. Despite societal
expectations, Rika was determined to pursue higher
education. "My father was not too keen on sending me to
college," she explained, but her eldest brother's support

was crucial. "He said, 'She's going to college,' and that was
it," she recounted. Rika attended Khalsa College, earning a
Bachelor of Science degree in Botany and Chemistry. "I
chose science because I was always curious about how
things work. Botany and Chemistry fascinated me," she
explained.

Dreaming of America
F r o m a y o u n g a ge , R i k a
harbored dreams of moving to
America. "In the 1960s, very
few people had the thought of
moving to America, but I was
82

determined," she said. Her aspiration was fueled by her
brother's move to the U.S., making the dream seem more
tangible. "When my brother moved to America in the early
60s, it gave me hope. I thought if he can do it, so can I," she
reminisced.

Marriage and Move to the U.S.
Rika's life took a signi cant turn in 1972 when she
married Manu Shah and moved to Cleveland, Ohio. The
transition from the warm climate of Mumbai to the cold
winters of Cleveland was challenging both physically and

fi

83

emotionally. "It was a major change, not just the weather
but adjusting to a new culture and lifestyle," Rika noted.
"We got married in December and moved to the U.S. in
January. It was my rst time out of India, and it was
freezing in Cleveland," she recalled. The lack of a social
network made the initial months particularly tough. "We
had a few bachelor friends, but as a family, it was not easy,"
she said.

Historical Context: 1972 Cleveland, Immigrant
Welcoming America
In 1972, Cleveland, Ohio, was a bustling industrial city
known for its rich cultural diversity and economic
opportunities. The city, like much of America, was shaped
by waves of immigration that brought people from various
parts of the world seeking better lives and new
opportunities. During this time, Cleveland was a prime
example of Americ a's welcoming spirit towards
immigrants. The c it y's economy was driven by
manufacturing and industry, o ering numerous jobs that
attracted immigrants from Europe, Asia, and other regions.
Cleveland's neighborhoods re ected its cultural mosaic,
with vibrant communities of Italians, Poles, Irish, and
more, each contributing to the city's unique character. This
era was also marked by signi cant advancements in civil
rights, with e orts to promote equality and integration
gaining momentum. For new immigrants, including those
like Manu Shah and his family, Cleveland provided a
suppor tive environment where diverse cultural
backgrounds were respected and valued. The city’s

ff

fi

fl

fi

ff

84

institutions, from schools to community centers, played a
crucial role in helping immigrants assimilate and thrive in
their new homeland. This welcoming atmosphere, coupled
with the economic opportunities available, made Cleveland
a beacon of hope and progress for many immigrants in the
early 1970s.

Early Jobs and Challenges
Rika's adaptability and willingness to embrace new
experiences were crucial in overcoming the hurdles of her
new life. "Every challenge I faced, every obstacle I
overcame, made me stronger and more determined to
succeed," she re ected. Navigating life in a new country
required constant learning and adaptation. "I had to learn
about the American way of life, the culture, the people, and
even the food," she said.
One signi cant aspect of her adjustment was balancing
professional commitments with family responsibilities. "I
was pregnant in 1974, which made me think about my
future and what I wanted to do," Rika shared. She decided
to start a business that allowed her to stay home and take
care of her children. "I wanted to do something meaningful
while also being there for my family," she said.

Career Aspirations and Initial Ventures
Rika's entrepreneurial spirit began to take shape as she
navigated her new life in America. "I always wanted to do
something more than just a job. I wanted to create
something of my own," she said.

fl

85

Lessons from Early Life and Career
Rika’s early experiences were lled with lessons that
shaped her entrepreneurial journey. "Every job, every
interaction taught me something new. It was all part of the
learning process," she re ected. Her ability to adapt, learn,
and persevere in the face of challenges was instrumental in
her success. Re ecting on her journey, Rika said, "Moving
to America was a life-changing experience. It wasn't easy,
but it was worth it. Every challenge I faced, every obstacle I
overcame made me stronger and more determined." Her
story is a testament to the resilience and determination
required to navigate life in a new country and build a
successful career from the ground up.

Dreams as the Bedrock of
Reality
This chapter emphasizes Manu Shah’s strong belief in the power
of dreams as the foundation for achieving real-world success. For
Manu, dreams were not idle thoughts but seeds that, with hard work
and strategic planning, could grow into reality. This philosophy
shaped his career, from rejecting conventional job o ers to
becoming a visionary entrepreneur. At MSI, Manu’s dreams drove
innovation, including pioneering changes in material sourcing and
distribution. He cultivated a culture of dreaming within his
company, encouraging his employees to think big and envision their
role in a larger mission.

ff

87

or Manu Shah, dreaming was not just a passive state
of mind but a critical step towards achieving tangible
results. He rmly believed that many of the realities we
experience begin as dreams—in the quiet moments of
re ection, where imagination and ambition intertwine. To
Manu, dreaming was akin to planting seeds; each vision, a
seed that could sprout and transform into reality with the
right conditions of hard work, perseverance, and strategic
planning.
"Manu believed in dreaming. Many realities came from
dreams," encapsulates a philosophy that underpinned his
entire career and life journey. It was this capacity to
envision a future beyond the immediate and tangible that
propelled him from a diligent engineering student at
Purdue to a visionary entrepreneur who would one day
helm a leading global enterprise.

The Role of Dreams in Innovation
Innovation at MSI was not
merely a result of technical
expertise or market research,
but of daring to dream. For
instance, when Manu rst
conceptualized importing
black granite for the
American market, it was a
vision driven by the
understanding of its aesthetic
and functional superiority, even when conventional
wisdom cautioned against the high risks and logistical

fi

fi

fl

88

challenges. His dream of making high-quality materials
accessible and a ordable led to pioneering changes in how
materials were sourced and distributed.

Dreaming Beyond Conventional Wisdom
Manu’s decision to reject job o ers from industry giants
like IBM and instead join a smaller company underscores
his belief in personal growth and long-term outcomes over
immediate gains. His dreams were not con ned by the
prevailing norms but were instead guided by a broader
vision of his future. He understood that to truly learn every
aspect of a business, he needed a canvas smaller in size but
vast in opportunity—a place where his ideas could take root
and grow without being overshadowed.

Dreams as a Motivational Force
For Manu, dreams also served as a powerful motivational
force, pushing him through times of uncertainty and
challenge. When faced with the daunting task of supplying
black granite for the Vietnam War Memorial, it was his
dream-driven resolve that navigated the company through
the complexities of such a high-stakes project. His dream
not only encompassed the successful completion of the
project but also the broader impact of honoring veterans
and their sacri ces through his work.

Cultivating a Culture of Dreaming
At MSI, Manu cultivated a culture where dreams were
shared and nurtured. He encouraged his employees to

fi

ff

ff

fi

89

dream big, to see beyond their immediate job roles, and to
envision themselves as integral parts of a larger mission.
This culture of dreaming and innovation is evident in MSI’s
continuous growth and adaptation, always staying ahead of
market trends and needs.
In summary, Manu Shah’s belief in the power of dreams
highlights a fundamental truth: that our greatest
achievements often start as fragments of our imagination.
By dreaming, we set the stage for what can be, and through
action, we bring those dreams to life. This ethos not only
shaped Manu’s life and MSI’s path but also serves as a
timeless reminder of the potential that lies within the
daring to dream

Quotes:
Les Brown: "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll
land among the stars."

there."

Parenting – Raising Raj and
Rup in America
This chapter explores how Rika and Manu Shah navigated the
challenges of raising their sons, Raj and Rup, in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, while running a business as Indian immigrants. They
emphasized family values, the importance of public schooling, and
involvement in the family business to teach responsibility. Their
parenting philosophy was built on leading by example, fostering
independence, and promoting emotional wellbeing through nontraditional activities like camping and family debates. The Midwest’s
strong work ethic and sense of community shaped their approach to
life and business, passing these values on to their children.

91

any people have asked Rika and Manu about their
parenting journey—how they managed to raise
two boys, Raj and Rup, in the middle of America while
running a business, and how they navigated the challenges
of being a small family of Indian immigrants in a
predominantly white community. This chapter dives into
their approach to parenting, the values they instilled, and
the lessons they learned while raising their children in a
unique environment.

Raising Kids in a New Culture
Rika and Manu raised their children in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, a place where they were surrounded by families
who were mostly white and where cultural diversity was
not the norm. Yet, they believed that the strength of their
own family values and the support of their small, close-knit
family would provide Raj and Rup with the foundation they
needed to thrive. From an early age, Raj and Rup were sent
to daycare at a local church, followed by attending a public
school. While many well-to-do and educated parents in
their community were sending their children to private
schools, Rika and Manu felt con dent that the public school
system would be just as valuable for their children,
believing that academic excellence comes from within the
child, not the school alone; Kids should learn and work
with all kinds of background not just elites.
They faced the challenge of juggling parenting while
building their edgling export business. Manu often
traveled extensively for his job at International Truck and
later for MSI, while Rika managed the house, kids, and the

fi

fl

92

business startup. There were no internet or cell phones in
those days, so the family relied on clever solutions, like
using an 800 number for MSI to ensure Manu could stay
connected to the business and the kids while traveling.
Despite the challenges, they made it work, ensuring that
the family and business ourished side by side..

Involving Kids in Business
From a young age, Raj and
Rup were introduced to the
family business. Simple
t asks bec ame le arning
opportunities—early
exposure to tools like
spreadsheets (SuperCalc,
L o t u s , a n d e ve n t u a l l y
Excel) helped build skills
and fostered a sense of
responsibility. Rika and
Manu believed that involving the kids in the business in a
meaningful way could teach them essential life skills. By the
time Raj was 10 and Rup was 7, the family had moved to
Cerritos, California, setting the stage for a new chapter in
both the business and their lives.

Parenting Philosophy
Rika and Manu embraced a parenting philosophy rooted
in their own experiences and values, always guided by their
belief in the importance of DNA and the example set by
parents. They believed strongly that children do what they

fl

93

see, not what they are told. Setting a positive example through their hard work, integrity, and devotion to family—
was paramount. The idea that “children learn by watching
and listening” shaped the way they parented, fostering an
environment where curiosity, innovation, and open
communication were encouraged.
Importantly, Rika and Manu never pushed perfectionism
or placed undue pressure on their children to perform.
They encouraged individuality, never comparing Raj or Rup
to each other or to other children. Instead, they focused on
helping wherever weaknesses emerged, building strengths
with patience and support.

E mo t i o n a l Ne e d s a n d No n -Tra d i t i o n a l
Activities
Recognizing the importance of emotional wellbeing, they
made sure to address Raj and Rup's emotional needs,
encouraging debates from an early age, respecting their
views even if they changed with time, and nurturing
inquisitiveness. Family time was not just limited to business
—camping trips, going to games, and engaging in
philanthropic work during Thanksgiving and Christmas
were important non-traditional activities that brought the
family together.

Financial Lessons and Curiosity
Rika and Manu also believed in teaching nancial
responsibility early on. They opened bank accounts for
their children within days of their birth, adding cash gifts to

the accounts and teaching Raj and Rup the value of money.
More importantly, they nurtured curiosity, innovation, and
outdoor activities. The local library became a favorite
destination, books were abundant, and the kids were
always encouraged to ask questions, experiment, and
explore.

Counter will Instinct and Encouraging
Independence
A unique part of their philosophy was recognizing and
respecting the “counter-will instinct”—the natural tendency
of children to do the opposite of what they are told. Rather
than discouraging this instinct, they used it as a tool for
learning, fostering curiosity and the desire to forge their
own path. They saw this as an important part of developing
independence and resilience.
Through their unique approach to parenting, Rika and
Manu balanced family, business, and the cultural
challenges of raising children in America, ensuring that Raj
and Rup grew into responsible, curious, and independent
adults. Their parenting style was based on love, respect,
and the belief that children will ourish if given the right
foundation, the freedom to explore, and the support to
grow.

Embracing American Values in the Midwest
(1972 1984)
From the moment Manu and Rika Shah arrived in
America, they were struck by the abundance of

fl

opportunities and the core values that shaped the country,
particularly in the Midwest, where they began their
journey. The Midwest, often referred to as the "Heartland"
of America, is known for its strong work ethic, sense of
community, and family values. Manu and Rika, both of
whom came from large families in India, found themselves
resonating deeply with these principles.

The Midwest: A Land of Opportunity and
Community
Living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from 1973 to 1984, Manu
and Rika were surrounded by hardworking, middle-class
families who prioritized family, education, and community.
They observed that, unlike in many other parts of the
world, opportunities in America were plentiful and
accessible to those willing to work hard. This realization
reinforced their belief in the American Dream and fueled
their determination to succeed both personally and
professionally.
Manu and Rika quickly
embraced the Midwest
values of self-reliance
and mutual support.
The snowstorms of
1978 and 1981, which
shut down much of
the Midwest for days,
provided a rsthand
lesson in the
importance of

fi

community. The Shah family witnessed neighbors helping
each other, clearing driveways, and ensuring that everyone
had what they needed. These experiences not only
reinforced their own values but also provided important
lessons for their children, Raj and Rup, who grew up
watching and learning from these acts of kindness and
solidarity.

Rejecting Negative In uences
While the Midwest o ered a wealth of positive in uences,
Manu and Rika were also acutely aware of the potential
pitfalls that could derail their family's progress. They made
a conscious decision to avoid negative in uences such as
drugs, gangs, alcohol, smoking, partying, and gambling.
They had not come to America for these activities, and they
were determined to shield their family from them. Instead,
they focused on the values that had brought them to the
United States: hard work, education, and the opportunity
to build a better life.
In this regard, they were successful in instilling these
values in their children. Even today, Raj and Rup are proud
of their Midwest roots, grateful for the solid foundation
their parents provided. They often speak about how
growing up in the Midwest, surrounded by educated,
hardworking people, shaped their outlook on life and their
approach to business and family.

The period from 1973 to 1984 was a time of signi cant
change in the United States. The country was emerging
from the tumultuous 1960s and early 1970s, characterized
by the Vietnam War, civil rights struggles, and economic
challenges. The Midwest, with its strong manufacturing
base and agricultural roots, played a crucial role in
America's recovery and growth during this period.
The 1970s saw the rise of the American middle class,
driven by the post-war economic boom and the expansion
of manufacturing industries in the Midwest. However, the
late 1970s and early 1980s also brought economic
challenges, including in ation, unemployment, and ener y
crises. Despite these challenges, the Midwest remained a
beacon of stability and resilience, with its residents
embodying the values of hard work, thrift, and community.
For Manu and Rika, these years were formative. They saw
rsthand how Americans persevered through tough times,
supporting each other and working tirelessly to provide for
their families. This resilience left a lasting impression on
them, shaping their approach to both business and life.

Building a Legacy for Future Generations
Through their time in the Midwest, Manu and Rika not
only built a growing business but also a legacy of strong
family values, ethical behavior, and communit y
involvement. They passed these values on to Raj and Rup,

g

fi

who continue to embody them in their own lives and
careers. The Midwest experience taught the Shah family
that success is not just about nancial achievement but
about building a life grounded in integrity, hard work, and
a deep commitment to family and community.
Manu and Rika's story is a testament to the power of the
American Dream, especially in the heartland of the
country. It is a reminder that with the right values and a
strong sense of purpose, anyone can achieve their goals
and leave a legacy for future generations.

Simple Parenting Rules: Empowering Children
for Their Own Future
In their journey as parents, Manu and Rika followed a set
of guiding principles that helped them raise their children,
Raj and Rup, with a focus on growth, independence, and
positivity. Here are a few simple but e ective rules that they
embraced:
1. Let Kids Chart Their Own Path
Every child must have the freedom to build their own
future and achieve their own successes. As parents, it's
important to assist them when needed, but not to
overpressure them. If your child doesn’t enjoy activities like
dancing, robotics, or music, it's essential to respect their
preferences and not force them into something that doesn't
resonate with them.

ff

fi

99

Children should never feel pressured or compared to
others. Whether it's regarding family circumstances,
nancial situations, or even the history of relatives,
negative feelings should be avoided. It's crucial to create an
environment where they feel supported rather than
burdened by expectations they cannot control.
3. Encourage Growth, No Matter How Big or Small
Growth should be encouraged in every aspect of a child’s
life, whether in academics, sports, or hobbies. Being
number one is not the goal. It’s more important that
children learn, improve, and enjoy the process, even if they
don’t achieve the highest scores or ranks in school or
games. Failure should never be viewed as the end, but as a
learning experience.
4. Focus on Positive Stories
Whenever possible, share positive stories that inspire
and uplift children. Focus on their strengths and the good
things that happen, no matter how small. Positivity is a key
ingredient in nurturing self-con dence and resilience in
children.
5. Teach Contentment and Acceptance
One of the most important lessons is to accept the
tools, assets, and resources we have and to work with them
to the best of our ability. Children should be discouraged
from the "if only" mindset—"if we had more, we could have
100
fi

fi

2. Avoid Negative Comparisons or Pressure

done better." Teach them the value of contentment and the
belief that they can achieve great things with the resources
available to them.
By following these simple rules, Manu and Rika ensured
that their children grew up feeling empowered, supported,
and encouraged, while allowing them the freedom to
pursue their own paths and dreams. This parenting
approach created a foundation of positivity, resilience, and
self-reliance that Raj and Rup carry with them to this day.
Here are some quotes on parenting that align with the
principles Manu and Rika followed:
Quotes:
Khalil Gibran: "Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself."
Og Mandino"The greatest legacy we can leave our
children is happy memories."
Ann Landers: "It is not what you do for your children,
but what you have taught them to do for themselves that
will make them successful human beings."
Robert Fulghum: "Don’t worry that children never
listen to you; worry that they are always watching you." –
Matthew Jacobson: "Behind every young child who
believes in himself is a parent who believed rst."
Margaret Mead: "Children must be taught how to think,
not what to think."

The Strength of Extended
Family
This chapter highlights the importance of extended family in
Manu and Rika Shah’s lives. Both grew up in large families, where
they learned leadership, care, and responsibility at a young age. As
MSI grew, Manu and Rika extended their support to their extended
family by providing jobs and internships, while fostering deep
relationships with suppliers. Their philosophy of treating employees
and partners like family helped MSI grow into a successful company
with a loyal workforce. The joy of being grandparents and
maintaining strong family connections continues to enrich their
lives.

103

anu Shah, the ninth of nine children, and Rika
Shah, the seventh of eight, both came from large
families where the concepts of extended family and
community were deeply ingrained. Growing up in such
environments, they were surrounded by numerous
nephews and nieces, many of whom were only slightly
younger than themselves. This early exposure to large
family dynamics turned them into babysitters, care
providers, and peer advisors even before reaching
adulthood.

104

Early Lessons in Leadership and Care
From a young age, Manu and Rika learned the value of
responsibility and leadership. Manu, being the rst in his
family to move to the USA, and Rika, the second, became
guiding lights for their extended family. They provided
invaluable advice on education, career choices, and life
decisions, helping many family members navigate their
paths. Their home in the USA became a hub of guidance
and support, signi cantly impacting the lives of their
nephews and nieces.

Creating Opportunities for the Extended
Family
As MSI grew, Manu and Rika extended their support to
providing jobs and summer internships to their extended
family members. This not only strengthened familial bonds
but also brought diverse perspectives and talents into the
company. The lessons learned from managing a large
extended family were instrumental in managing MSI's
extensive supply chain, which spanned 35 countries.
Treating suppliers as partners and fostering deep
relationships became second nature, resulting in a robust
and reliable supply chain network.

MSI as an Extended Family
The values of care and support that Manu and Rika
practiced within their family extended to MSI’s employees.
From a handful of employees, the company grew to over
3,000 by 2024, all considered part of the MSI family. The

fi

fi

philosophy of never laying o employees and always
prioritizing their well-being created a loyal and dedicated
workforce. This familial approach also contributed to the
personal growth of employees, fostering an environment
where everyone’s success was interconnected with MSI's
growth.

Grandchildren
The family dynamics further enriched with Raj's
marriage to Sona in 2003 and Rup's marriage to Mona in
2011. Both Sona and Mona, who are attorneys involved in
social services, were welcomed as "Daughter with Love".

The family continued to grow with the birth of Manu and
Rika’s grandchildren: Raj and Sona's son Rhyan (18) and
daughter Sophie (15), and Rup and Mona's boys Milan (10),
Rohan (8), and daughter Raina (6). The joy of being

ff

106

grandparents brought an unparalleled happiness to Manu
and Rika, who cherish every moment with their
grandchildren.

The Joy of Extended Family
For Manu and Rika, the joy of having an extended family
that includes not just their grandchildren, but also

nephews, nieces, employees, and supply chain partners, is
beyond words. This network of relationships has been a
source of strength, learning, and immense pride. The
experiences gained from their extended family have been
invaluable, shaping their approach to life and business.

Conclusion: An Ever-Growing Family
Manu and Rika Shah’s journey illustrates the power of
extended family. Their experiences and the lessons learned
from their large families have profoundly impacted their
approach to business and life. The joy and ful llment they
derive from their grandchildren, nephews, nieces,
employees, and supply chain partners are immeasurable.
For Manu and Rika, family is not just about blood relations
but includes all those whose lives they touch, making their
extended family truly boundless and deeply meaningful.

2.1
The Entrepreneurial Journey
of MSI
This chapter explores how Manu and Rika Shah built MSI from a
small home-based business into a global leader in the surfacing
industry. Manu’s entrepreneurial journey began out of necessity,
and his belief that entrepreneurship cannot be taught but is driven
by circumstance and innovation. Rika played an equally important
role, bringing simplicity and balance to business decisions.
Together, they took calculated risks, including securing a contract
for the Vietnam War Memorial, which propelled MSI into the
spotlight. Their approach to entrepreneurship is centered around
continuous learning, adaptability, and fostering a culture of
innovation at MSI.

110

ntrepreneurship is often
envisioned as a journey,
not just a destination—a
concept that Manu deeply
resonates with. He and his wife
Rika's entrepreneurial spirit
has been central to MSI's
growth from a small homebased operation to a global
leader in the surfacing
industry. We will explore key
lessons in entrepreneurship as
practiced and propagated by
Manu and Rika, re ecting on their personal experiences,
the growth of MSI, and the broader impacts of their
entrepreneurial vision.

The Essence of Entrepreneurship
Manu often re ects on the essence of entrepreneurship,
challenging the notion that it can be taught. "Many colleges
try to teach entrepreneurship, but I'm not sure you can
teach it. Either you're born an entrepreneur or
circumstances make you one, although, the basics can be
taught through practical experiences, college course,
internships and mentorship programs." he states
emphatically. Manu believes that necessity is the true
mother of invention. "If someone puts you on an island
alone, you either die or nd a way to survive. That’s how
entrepreneurship works—it's about doing what you
wouldn't in a comfortable environment."

fi

fl

fl

111

Manu's Path to Entrepreneurship:
Manu never set out to become an entrepreneur in the
traditional sense. In fact, he didn’t even know what the
term meant until 2007, when he was awarded the Ernst &
Young National Entrepreneur of the Year award. By then,
he had already built a ourishing business and garnered
national recognition, yet his journey into entrepreneurship
was more a natural progression than a deliberate pursuit.
For Manu, entrepreneurship was less about titles and more
about curiosity, problem-solving, and the drive to innovate.
It was something that had always been part of his life, even
from childhood.
From a young age, Manu’s inquisitiveness shaped his
approach to life. Growing up in a small apartment in India,
he found creative ways to optimize the limited space. This
curiosity extended to other aspects of his life—whether it
was organizing trips with fellow teenagers using detailed
maps typically reserved for foreign travelers or nding new
ways to navigate the challenges of daily life. Manu's
inventive spirit also came into play when, as a teenager, he
helped coordinate activities and solve logistical problems
that others often overlooked.
Manu's journey to the United States for further education
was yet another testament to his determination. Faced with
limited nancial resources and the challenge of learning
English, he secured loans to fund his studies at Purdue
University. His resilience and foresight in preparing for jobs
while still struggling with language barriers re ected his
ability to innovate under pressure. This same spirit later
drove Manu to launch a business with his wife Rika, even as

fl

fi

fl

fi

112

they were starting a family. What began as a side venture
soon turned into a thriving company, driven by Manu’s
relentless pursuit of e cienc y, innovation, and
improvement.
For Manu, entrepreneurship was never about chasing
labels or awards—it was about nding solutions, adapting to
challenges, and continuously pushing boundaries. He
believes that entrepreneurship isn’t con ned to the realm
of business; rather, it’s a mindset that can be applied to
every aspect of life. Whether it's solving logistical issues,
optimizing resources, or nding new ways to overcome
obstacles, Manu’s entrepreneurial spirit continues to guide
him. "Entrepreneurship is everywhere and should be in
your life—whether or not someone calls you an
entrepreneur," Manu says.
This perspective is grounded in his own journey. Manu's
entrepreneurial spirit was ignited by necessity and a
relentless drive to stay ahead of the competition. "When
you create an enemy—competition—you strive to stay
ahead," he explains. This mindset not only fuels individual
ambition but also unites teams. "Within our family and our
company, we've always worked together to overcome
external challenges, fostering a sense of unity and
purpose."

The Birth of MSI: A Partnership of Equals
Manu and his wife Rika started MSI from their twobedroom home in 1975. This venture was born out of both
necessity and a shared vision. "Starting a business with
your spouse has its challenges, but the advantages far

fi

fi

ffi

fi

113

outweigh them," Manu remarks. They balanced family
dynamics with business responsibilities, learning to
navigate disagreements and leveraging their
complementary skills.
Rika, a former math and science teacher, brought a
practical simplicity to their business decisions. "I tend to
complicate things as an engineer, but Rika keeps it simple,"
Manu admits. This dynamic partnership was pivotal in
laying the foundation for MSI's growth. They focused on
building a business that could expand sustainably,
emphasizing the importance of a strong foundation before
rapid growth.

The Early Years of MSI
The foundation years of MSI were marked by strategic
decisions and key moves. A lot of people may not know
this, but Manu and Rika started o by exporting integrated
circuits and memory chips, before they began importing
black granite blocks and monuments.
Manu's strategic approach involved building a solid
foundation for growth. "Between 1975 and 1982, we built
the foundation so I could quit my job. From 1982 to 1986,
we worked from home to de ne our focus and strate y," he
explains. This methodical approach allowed MSI to grow
organically, avoiding the pitfalls of overexpansion.

Manu and Rika's approach to entrepreneurship was
rooted in continual learning, and adaptability They exceled
in sourcing ideas, applying them innovatively, and
marrying the world’s oldest business with modern
technolo y to deliver unmatched value in their industry.
At MSI, they foster a culture that encourages calculated
risk-taking while building safet y nets to ensure
sustainability and resilience. Manu emphasizes the
importance of having a clear vision paired with the
exibility to adapt to changing market dynamics, which
keeps MSI relevant and competitive. Continuous education
and innovation are also key pillars of their success, as they
believe lifelong learning—whether it’s embracing new
technolo y, understanding market trends, or addressing
customer needs—is essential to staying ahead in a
competitive industry.

Entrepreneurial Challenges and Triumphs
High-tech versus low-tech entrepreneurship presents
distinct challenges and opportunities, each requiring a
strategic approach. MSI’s leadership has skillfully navigated
these di erences by harnessing the advantages of both lowtech simplicity and high-tech advancements.
In the high-tech arena, MSI has faced the challenges of
rapid market changes and high capital demands but has
turned these into opportunities by leveraging technolo y to

other hand, MSI has also embraced the stability and lower
capital requirements of low-tech sectors, which has
facilitated easier market entry and fostered sustainable
business practices.

Conclusion: A Legacy of Entrepreneurial
Leadership
Manu and Rika's entrepreneurial journey at MSI
exempli es how visionary leadership combined with a
robust understanding of both high-tech and low-tech
environments can create a sustainable and thriving
business. Their journey underscores the importance of
adaptability, continuous learning, and strategic foresight in
entrepreneurship. By fostering a culture that values risktaking, innovation, and a deep commitment to employee
development, MSI has not only achieved substantial growth
but has also contributed positively to the global
community.
This is an inspirational blueprint for current and future
entrepreneurs, illustrating that with the right approach,
challenges can be transformed into opportunities for
growth and leadership in any industry.

Historical Context
•
Post-Colonial India's Economic Landscape
(1950s-1970s): Manu’s journey from India to the U.S. in the 1970s
re ects a period when India was transitioning from colonial rule to
building its own economy. The country’s focus was largely on selfreliance, and opportunities for entrepreneurship were limited due to
stringent economic policies. For individuals like Manu, leaving
India to seek educational and business opportunities abroad was
not only a personal choice but also a necessity shaped by broader
economic forces.
•
Immigration Waves and Economic Contributions
(1960s-1980s): The Shah family’s entrepreneurial venture
coincided with signi cant waves of Indian immigration to the U.S.,
driven by changes in U.S. immigration law in 1965 that favored
skilled workers. The contribution of immigrant entrepreneurs like
Manu to the American economy was profound, particularly in
sectors like technolo y and small business, where they brought new
ideas and international perspectives.
•
Globalization and Shifts in Trade (1980s-1990s): MSI's
pivot to natural stone products during the early 1980s capitalized
on emerging globalization trends, which were transforming
industries worldwide. As global supply chains became more
integrated, MSI’s ability to source materials from places like India
and its eventual role in major projects. This period also saw shifts in
U.S. manufacturing, where imports became a key component of
business strate y.

g

fi

g

fl

117

Cultural Context
•
Indian Cultural In uence on Entrepreneurial Mindset:
Manu’s problem-solving and resourcefulness stem from traditional
Indian values of ‘jugaad’—a Hindi term referring to nding
innovative xes in resource-constrained environments. This cultural
mindset has often been credited with fostering entrepreneurial
abilities in Indian immigrants, who use limited resources to create
scalable, global businesses.
•
Family as a Core Business Unit in Indian Culture: The
role that Rika played in MSI’s success re ects the broader Indian
cultural norm of family-run businesses. In Indian society, families
often work together to create and manage enterprises, and the
balance of roles between husband and wife, as seen with Manu and
Rika, is typical of many Indian entrepreneurial ventures. Rika’s
contributions underscore the important but often underrepresented
role that women play in business, especially in Asian cultures.
•
Cultural Values of Adaptability and Lifelong Learning:
Manu’s belief in continuous learning and adaptability is aligned
with the Indian tradition of lifelong education. In many Eastern
philosophies, learning is seen as a lifelong endeavor, not con ned to
formal education but woven into everyday life experiences. This
cultural approach likely in uenced MSI's adaptability in both hightech and low-tech industries.
•
The American Dream and Immigrant Success: Manu
and Rika’s entrepreneurial success embodies the quintessential
American Dream narrative—where hard work, resilience, and
seizing opportunities allow immigrants to achieve success. This
journey resonates with many immigrants who arrive in the U.S.
seeking better prospects and end up contributing to the country’s
economy through business innovation.

Starting a Business with
your Spouse
This chapter explores the dynamics of starting a business with a
spouse, using the example of Manu and Rika. Their complementary
strengths, mutual respect, and shared values helped them navigate
both family and business responsibilities. Working from home, they
involved their children in MSI's early stages, balancing their roles as
parents and business owners. The Shahs' commitment to hard work
and building a strong foundation enabled MSI to thrive. They
fostered a family-like culture at MSI, which contributed to its
success. Together, they overcame numerous challenges, focusing on
shared goals and long-term growth.

119

tarting a business with a spouse can be both
rewarding and challenging. Manu and his wife, Rika,
navigated these dynamics with a clear understanding of
their complementary strengths. "Starting a business with
your spouse means you're in it together, 24/7," Manu
re ects. "But it also means you have a partner who shares
your vision and commitment."

Also means you can’t re spouse employee and do not
worry about pay raise!

Their partnership was built
on mutual respect and shared
values. Rika brought practical
simplicity to their business
decisions, while Manu, with
his engineering mindset,
focused on innovation and
strate y. "We balanced each
other out," Manu notes. "Rika
kept things simple, and I
focused on the technical and strategic aspects."

Balancing Family and Business
Manu and Rika’s ability to
balance family and business
responsibilities was crucial
to their success. "Our home
was our rst o ce, and our
children grew up seeing the
business evolve," Manu
re c a l l s . T h i s c l o s e - k n i t
environment fostered a
sense of unity and shared
purpose. "We involved our
children in the business early on, teaching them the value
of hard work and perseverance."
Manu and Rika's commitment to family extended to their
business philosophy. "We treated our employees like
family," Manu states. "This created a supportive and loyal
workforce, which was critical to our growth." This

ffi

fi

g

121

approach also helped them navigate the challenges of
running a business while raising a family.

Building MSI Together
The early years of MSI were marked by long hours and
hard work. "We started in our basement, working day and
night to get the business o the ground," Manu recalls.
Their rst major success came with the contract to supply
black granite for the Vietnam War Memorial. "That project
was a turning point for us," Manu notes. "It was a signi cant
risk, but we knew failure was not an option."
"We built the business step by step, focusing on creating
a strong foundation," Manu explains. This methodical
approach allowed them to scale the business sustainably,
avoiding the pitfalls of overexpansion.

Shared Values and Organizational Culture
Manu and Rika's shared values were integral to MSI's
organizational culture. "We came from large, lower middleclass families where hard work and education were highly
valued," Manu explains. These values shaped MSI's culture,
e m p h a s i z i n g r e s p e c t , l o y a l t y, a n d c o n t i n u o u s

Their approach to business was also in uenced by their
family dynamics. "In a large family, you learn to navigate
di erent personalities and strengths," Manu notes. "We
applied these lessons to our business, building a diverse

and inclusive team." This approach fostered a collaborative
and supportive work environment.

Navigating Challenges Together
Manu and Rika faced
numerous challenges in their
journey, from economic
downturns to competitive
pressures. "Every challenge
was an opportunity to learn
and grow," Manu states. Their
ability to navigate these
challenges together
strengthened their
partnership and the business.
"We faced each obstacle with
determination and

resilience," he adds.

A key strate y that guided their success was setting clear,
achievable goals. "We always put a time limit on our goals,
pushing ourselves to achieve them within a set timeframe,"
Manu explains. This disciplined approach kept them
focused and driven, enabling them to overcome obstacles
and achieve sustained growth.

Re e c ting Honor: The
Vietnam War Memorial
Project
This chapter details MSI’s pivotal role in supplying the black
granite for the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C., a
project that became a turning point for both the company and
Manu Shah. Despite being a small enterprise, MSI took on the
daunting task of sourcing the nest black granite from India.
Manu’s strategic decisions and perseverance allowed MSI to
overcome logistical challenges, including transporting heavy
granite blocks and facing opposition from gures like Ross Perot.
The memorial, completed in 1982, stands as both a symbol of
national remembrance and MSI’s dedication to excellence. The
project was emotionally signi cant for Manu, who attended the
dedication with his family, re ecting on the personal and collective
impact of the war.

fi

fi

fi

fl

fl

127

n the early 1980s, amidst a backdrop of controversy
surrounding the Vietnam War, a monumental project
was conceived to honor those who served and sacri ced.

The Fine Arts Commission in Washington D.C. held a blind
competition to design a memorial that would resonate
deeply with the American public. The winning design, a
striking V-shaped wall proposed by Maya Lin, a young
architecture student of Chinese ancestry from Dayton,
Ohio, was selected unanimously in 1981. Her concept was
simple yet profound: a polished black granite wall inscribed
with the names of over 58,000 servicemen and women
who died in Vietnam, designed to allow visitors to see their
re ections alongside the names, prompting personal
re ection on the war’s impacts.

MSI’s Unlikely Role
At this juncture, Manu and
Rika Shah’s small business,
MSI, operating out of their
basement, was presented with
a daunting yet potentially
transformative opportunity.
The project required the best
re ective black granite

viable source.
Despite being a relatively very
small enterprise, MSI’s commitment to achieving the
seemingly impossible began with Manu deploying a thirdparty agent to India to assess quarries. The agent’s mission
was to document the quarrying process and reassure the
main contractor that MSI could deliver the high-quality
granite needed for the memorial.

fi

fl

129

In the early 1980s, the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington D.C. became a subject of intense debate, not
only for its symbolic signi cance but also for its design and
material. The original design by Maya Lin, featuring a Vshaped wall inscribed with the names of fallen soldiers, was
intended to be constructed from polished black granite.
This choice of material drew sharp criticism from some,
including businessman Ross Perot, who opposed the use of
black granite, arguing that it symbolized negativity and
defeat. Perot and other critics preferred a more traditional
memorial made from white or lighter-colored stone, which
they believed would better honor the sacri ces of
American soldiers. Despite the controversy, the decision to
use black granite prevailed, and the memorial, completed
in 1982, has since become an iconic and revered symbol of
remembrance and healing, widely praised for its stark,
re ective surface that allows visitors to see their own
re ections among the names of the fallen, thereby creating
a powerful, personal connection to the legacy of the
Vietnam War.

Overcoming Logistical Nightmares
The task was herculean: quarrying, transporting, and
nishing massive blocks of ne black granite without the
aid of modern machinery. Traditional methods were
employed, involving laborious human e ort to move each

Vietnam War Memorial's Black Granite

block inches at a time with shouts of "hi-ho" synchronizing
their painstaking e orts. More than half of the quarried
blocks broke during transport, necessitating the
procurement of signi cantly more material than initially
calculated.
The journey from quarry to the shores of America was
fraught with risks and setbacks. Each block was transported
to Mangalore, a small coastal town in India, where they
were ingeniously unloaded onto ships bound for New York.
Opposition from powerful political gures like Ross Perot,
who derisively called the design a "Black Ditch," and
domestic granite industries lobbying against foreign
materials, added to the project’s controversies.

The Turning Point
The arrival of the granite blocks in New York Harbor in
March 1982 marked a pivotal moment. A CBS news crew
captured the unloading process, broadcasting it during
prime time, which helped to quell some of the public
dissent, and paved the way for the next critical phase—
cutting and polishing the granite slabs in Vermont.
Unfortunately, initial mistakes by the block cutter led to
cracks in the rst four slabs, requiring MSI to urgently
arrange for additional blocks.

Completion and Re ection
By late summer of 1982, all polished slabs were ready and
began to be installed at the memorial site. The meticulous
carving of the names added the nal, somber touch to the

fi

fi

fl

fi

ff

fi

131

memorial. When news broke on September 23 that the last
panel had been installed, the impact of what had been
achieved—against all odds—began to sink in.
The following Monday, Manu tendered his resignation at
International Truck, a poignant decision marking his full
commitment to MSI. This project was not just MSI’s highestrisk endeavor but also its most prestigious, de ning the
company’s path forward.

Legacy of the Vietnam War Memorial
The Vietnam War Memorial stands today not just as a
testament to those who served but also as a symbol of MSI’s
capacity to meet extraordinary challenges. For Manu and
Rika, this project underscored their belief in the possible,
no matter how daunting the task. It was a rea rmation of
their entrepreneurial spirit, one that would guide MSI in
the years to come as a leader in sourcing and providing
materials that not only meet but exceed expectations in
both quality and signi cance.

Dedication Day: A Mosaic of Pride and Grief:

fi

ffi

fi

132

This day marked a poignant chapter in their lives, and for
Manu, it was a deeply emotional experience that brought
together feelings of pride and sorrow. Manu, Rika, and their
two young sons left Fort Wayne to attend the dedication of
the Memorial on Veterans Day, November 11, 1982. It was a
sad and tragic scene; Over 300,000 veterans had turned up
at every hotel corner. Many veterans were in wheelchairs,
some missing one or both hands; countless others used
assistive devices. Numerous family members, who had lost
loved ones, placed owers and small ags at the corners of
their names on the wall. It was also a proud moment for
MSI and for Manu, who could have been drafted to serve in
Vietnam. Even today, the Vietnam War Memorial remains
one of the most visited public memorials.

Tears of Re ection
For Manu, the sight of so many who had served and
sacri ced was heart-wrenching. Tears owed as he walked
along the wall, each step revealing more names, more
reminders of the war’s brutal reality. In fact, he had also
received a draft number – 282 – that was based on his

fl

fl

fl

fl

fi

133

birthdate. It was particularly poignant considering Manu's
own brush with destiny as he too could have been called to
serve in the very con ict commemorated by the wall. This
realization brought a personal dimension to the memorial’s
signi cance, intertwining his fate with those inscribed on
the granite.

A Proud Moment for MSI
Despite the somber mood, the dedication also served as a
proud moment for MSI. The company’s contribution to the
memorial—a symbol of national re ection and healing—was
a signi cant achievement. The quality of the granite and
the precision of the craftsmanship stood as testaments to
MSI's commitment to excellence, even under the most
challenging conditions. This project had not only tested
MSI's operational capabilities but also its resilience and
dedication to a cause greater than itself.

Legacy and Return Visits
Since that Veterans Day in 1982, the Vietnam War
Memorial has remained one of the most visited memorials
in the United States. Its re ective surface continues to serve
as a canvas for personal re ection and public mourning.
Manu has returned to the site at least ve times over the
years, each visit reinforcing the profound impact of the
memorial on his life and work.
These visits are a reminder of the delicate balance
between pride in MSI’s accomplishments and the solemnity
of the memorial's purpose. For Manu, the memorial stands

fi

fl

fl

fl

fl

fi

fi

134

as a lasting symbol of what can be achieved when one
commits wholeheartedly to an endeavor that seeks to
honor and remember.

Re ections on Legacy
As Manu stands before the wall, the re ections of visitors
in the granite merge with the engraved names, a poignant
interplay between the past and the present, the lost and the
living. It is a place where personal and collective histories
converge, where memories are kept alive through the
simple act of remembrance.
This chapter of Manu and Rika’s journey with MSI
encapsulates more than just a business milestone; it
represents a meaningful intersection of history, humanity,
and the enduring spirit of community service. The Vietnam
War Memorial project remains a cornerstone of MSI’s
legacy, a testament to facing immense challenges with
integrity and determination.

Quotes:
Maya Lin: "To me, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a
place where something can happen between the living and
the dead."
Winston Churchill: "Success is not nal, failure is not
fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."
Martin Luther King Jr.: "The ultimate measure of a man is

controversy."
Historical Context
1. Vietnam War and its Impact (1955 1975): The Vietnam
War had a deep and lasting impact on the U.S., resulting in the
deaths of over 58,000 American soldiers and leaving the nation
divided. The Vietnam War Memorial, designed by Maya Lin and
completed in 1982, emerged from this emotional and politically
charged context. The use of black granite, despite initial opposition,
symbolized both mourning and re ection, allowing the memorial to
serve as a place of healing for veterans and families.
2. Memorialization through Architecture (1980s): The
memorial's minimalist design was a radical departure from
traditional war monuments. The use of polished black granite,
which was sourced and provided by MSI, emphasized personal
re ection and public remembrance. This marked a turning point in
memorial design, in uencing future projects worldwide.
Cultural Context
1. Public Controversy over the Memorial’s Design: The
choice of black granite was controversial, as many saw it as a
symbol of defeat rather than honor. However, the decision to
proceed highlighted changing attitudes toward how wars and their
casualties are remembered—moving from glori cation to re ection.
2. Immigrant Contribution to National Legacy: MSI, a
relatively small business started by Indian immigrants, contributed
to a deeply symbolic national monument. This re ects the broader
story of immigrant integration into American society.

Black Granite in Homes:
Romancing the Black
Beauty
This chapter highlights how MSI revolutionized the use of Indian
black granite in the U.S., moving it beyond memorials and into
homes. Traditionally seen as a somber material, MSI rebranded
black granite, showcasing its durability, versatility, and elegance for
residential and commercial applications. By 1986, after the
successful installation of black granite countertops in a Beverly Hills
home, the trend took o nationwide. MSI’s innovative e orts led to
the popularization of Premium Plus Black Granite and the
introduction of Black Galaxy, making black granite a staple in home
design. Today, MSI remains the largest supplier of black granite in
the U.S.

ff

ff

137

n 1981, MSI was operating from Rika & Manu Shah’s
basement, focusing on growing their business amidst
an expanding black granite market. Black granite was used
in 52 classic memorials globally, including the Vietnam War
Memorial and Bruce Lee Memorial in Washington, D.C.
That year, MSI secured the contract to supply black granite
for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
Manu and Rika invested their entire savings and worked
tirelessly to ensure the project's success, revolutionizing the
perception and use of Indian black granite in the United
States.
The western world went gaga over the Indian back
granite. If you are surprised to read this, let me surprise
you a bit more! From innovative sculptures to classic
memorials, Indian granite had fascinated the world with its
magni cence. It was time to introduce our black beauty as
the biggest staple for other decorative purposes in the west.
Research and development are one of MSI’s many
strengths. MSI has a tradition of coming up with unusual
ideas that add value at multiple steps, making our products
and services unique. Through MSI, Manu made sure the
black beauty got the attention it deserved.
Creating new selling ideas from limited resources is an
innovation in itself. – Kishor Panchani, Senior Vice

Scope For More

Traditionally, black granite was associated with grief and
used for memorials. People feared that using black granite
would make their homes feel and look darker. But MSI
looked at it as a unique product with features that can be
used in many other applications within the home. It took
MSI a while to convince the people that the hard, smooth,
and mirror-like glossy Indian granite was much more than
just a tombstone.
One of the signi cant advantages of black granite is its
strength and durability. It was a great option for high-usage
areas such as kitchen and bathroom countertops. As an
igneous rock formed under extreme pressures, it had the
capability to withstand everyday wear and tear with low
maintenance. It wasn’t easily a ected by heat or scratching.
It had a low water absorption rate, resulting in no stains
and high re ectivity.

ff

fi

fl

139

Moreover, it was incredibly versatile. It was formal as
well as neutral and could suit traditional, transitional, and
contemporary designs. It could easily be incorporated into
any color palette, providing a timeless look.

Leaving No Stone Unturned
In 1986, MSI realized that natural stone for residential
and commercial usage had even larger market potential
and pivoted their e orts towards developing this sector. In
July 1986, when one couple in Beverly Hills chose MSI’s
Premium Plus Black Granite for their kitchen countertop,
the tide turned in favor of this unique stone. People
noticed! Soon many homes in the area wanted to install
black granite. By November, the trend spread to
Manhattan, NY. There was no looking back.
In February 1987, MSI introduced and trademarked Black
Galaxy, another black granite. We also popularized the use
of Premium Plus Black in the United States. In 1997, by
opening a second location in Edison, New Jersey, MSI
became the rst nationwide distributor of natural stones.
Once regarded as a stone associated with death, black
granite was now a coveted design element, used in homes
and o ces: from kitchens and bathrooms to ooring and
facades: “Memorializing Dead person to Serving Living
People”.

Growing Glory
To date, MSI remains the largest supplier of Black Granite
in the US. Natural stones generally possess a timeless
appeal, but black granite in particular, has remained a
prominent product that hasn’t lost its appeal since its
venture into our living spaces. MSI and Black granite not
only share a history together but also remain strong and
versatile, adapting to the changing trends and testing times.
Historical Context
1. Shift in Material Usage (1980s): In the early 1980s, black
granite was traditionally associated with memorials and somber
spaces. However, MSI's successful marketing of the material for
residential use, starting in Beverly Hills in 1986, coincided with
broader trends of incorporating natural materials into interior
design. This marked a signi cant cultural shift in how consumers
perceived and used black granite, transforming it from a funerary
material to a symbol of luxury and durability in homes.
2. Growth of the U.S. Housing Market (1980s): The U.S.
experienced a housing boom in the 1980s, providing opportunities
for innovative building materials to be incorporated into residential
architecture. MSI's introduction of black granite into homes
coincided with this growing demand for luxury home features.
Cultural Context
1. Cultural Transformation of Design Aesthetics:
Traditionally, black granite was seen as a symbol of grief. MSI's
e orts rebranded it as a sleek, modern material for homes,
re ecting the growing consumer appetite for durable and unique
design choices in the 1980s. This mirrors broader cultural shifts

fi

fl

ff

141

toward minimalism and industrial aesthetics in the interior design
world.
2. Adaptation of Indian Materials to Western Tastes: By
introducing black granite from India into U.S. homes, MSI bridged
two cultures, adapting Indian natural resources to meet Western
design sensibilities. This highlights the globalization of material
sourcing and the blending of aesthetic traditions across continents.

De ning Entrepreneurship
and Adaptabilit y - The
Power of Adaptability
This chapter discusses Manu Shah's de nition of
entrepreneurship, not merely as the act of starting a business, but as
a mindset grounded in resilience and adaptability. For Manu, an
entrepreneur is someone who never accepts "no" as a nal answer
and consistently turns challenges into opportunities. His journey
with MSI re ects this adaptability, particularly when he
transitioned from engineering to the granite industry. Through
strategic foresight, calculated risks, and continuous learning, MSI
grew into a global powerhouse. Even in times of economic
downturn, Manu's ability to pivot and adapt helped the company
maintain stability and gain market share. By emphasizing
innovation, risk-taking, strategic thinking, and the adoption of new
technologies, Manu demonstrates that the key to entrepreneurial
success lies in being agile, a lesson reinforced by the examples of
pioneers like Alexander Graham Bell and Steve Jobs.

143

or
Manu,
entrepreneurship is
more than just starting a
business; it's a mindset and
a way of life. "An
entrepreneur never takes
'no' for an answer," Manu
states emphatically. This
relentless drive and
resilience are core to his
de nition
of
entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs, in his view,
are individuals who see
opportunities where others see obstacles and have the
tenacity to pursue their vision despite challenges.
Warren Bu ett, one of America's most renowned
entrepreneurs, shares a similar sentiment: "In the business
world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the
windshield." This quote encapsulates the essence of
entrepreneurial foresight and the importance of learning
from the past while relentlessly pushing forward.

Key Qualities of an Entrepreneur
Manu believes that certain qualities are essential for
anyone aspiring to be an entrepreneur. The main one is
adaptability. "Circumstances make an entrepreneur," he
notes, emphasizing that often, the drive to start a business
arises from a need to overcome adversity or seize an
unexpected opportunity.

ff

fi

144

Manu outlines critical characteristics of Entrepreneur
forever:
• Does what others don’t do
• Takes calculated risks
• Learns from failures
• Never takes 'no' for an answer
• Focuses on growth
• Embraces technolo y and innovations
• Practices strategic thinking
These qualities, Manu argues, are not just inherent traits
but can also be cultivated through experience and
continuous learning.

The Role of Adaptability in Entrepreneurship
Adaptability is a cornerstone of Manu's entrepreneurial
philosophy. "Adaptability is the key to survival in business,"
he asserts. This ability to pivot and adjust strategies in
response to changing circumstances has been crucial to his
success. "In every challenge, there is an opportunity," he
adds, re ecting on how his adaptability has allowed him to
turn potential setbacks into stepping stones.
Historical examples abound of entrepreneurs who
thrived on adaptability. One notable example is Alexander
Graham Bell, who pivoted from his initial work on
improving the telegraph to inventing the telephone,
revolutionizing global communication. Similarly, Steve Jobs'
ability to adapt and innovate was instrumental in Apple's
transformation into a tech giant.

g

fl

145

Historical Context
The landscape of entrepreneurship has evolved signi cantly over
the decades, shaped by technological advancements, economic
shifts, and cultural changes. In the late 20th century, the rise of
Silicon Valley and tech innovations have continuously rede ned
industries and challenged businesses to adapt or perish. A notable
example is Kodak, a giant in the analog photography market, which
faced a pivotal challenge with the advent of digital photography
integrated into smartphones. Despite being a pioneer in digital
imaging technolo y, Kodak was slow to transition from its
traditional lm-based business model. This hesitation allowed
competitors to capitalize on the digital photography boom,
eventually leading to Kodak's bankruptcy in 2012. This case
highlights the critical need for companies to adapt to technological
disruptions, regardless of their past successes or market dominance.
During the 1960s and 1970s, when Manu began his
entrepreneurial journey, the global business environment was
marked by rapid industrialization and technological change.
Companies had to be agile to survive and thrive. Manu's ability to
navigate this dynamic landscape by constantly adapting his
strategies is a testament to his entrepreneurial acumen.

Opportunities in Challenges
Manu's journey is replete with instances where his
adaptability proved crucial. One such example is his
decision to enter the granite and stone business, a sector
vastly di erent from his engineering background. "I saw an
opportunity in the growing demand for natural stone," he
recalls. This strategic pivot not only diversi ed his business
portfolio but also positioned him as a key player in a
booming industry.

fi

fi

fi

ff

146

He also recounts the challenges he faced during
economic downturns. "During 2008 and 2021, many
businesses cut back, but we saw it as a chance to gain
market share," Manu explains. By focusing on cost
management and e ciency, he was able to maintain
stability and even grow MSI during tough times.
Bill Gates, re ecting on his own entrepreneurial journey,
once said, "Your most unhappy customers are your greatest
source of learning." Manu's approach aligns with this
perspective, as he views challenges and feedback as
opportunities for growth and improvement.

The MSI Journey and Milestones
The story of MSI (M S International Inc.) is a testament to
Manu's entrepreneurial vision and adaptability. Founded in
1975 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, MSI has grown into a global
powerhouse in the stone and surfaces industry. Manu's
ability to foresee market trends and adapt accordingly has
been pivotal to MSI's success.
From its humble beginnings, MSI has evolved into a
major player in the industry. The company now boasts over
3,000 employees across North America and supports
400,000 jobs worldwide. "In spite of MSI growing to over
3,000 employees, we remain nimble and have never laid
o anyone for lack of work," Manu proudly states.
The company's journey is marked by signi cant
milestones that re ect Manu's strategic vision and
adaptability. In 1981, MSI supplied materials for the

fi

fl

ff

147

Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a signi cant achievement that
put the company on the map. By 2003, MSI had opened a
10,000 sq. ft. wholesale natural stone gallery, expanding its
market presence.
The company's in uence continued to grow, supplying
materials to Atlanta Harts eld-Jackson Airport's new
International Terminal in 2011. By 2019, MSI Surfaces had
won the Top Workplaces award from the Atlanta JournalConstitution, highlighting the company's positive work
environment.
MSI's grow th is also re ec ted in its nancial
achievements. The company achieved over $2 billion in
annual revenues by 2021, demonstrating its sustained
success. "We have always focused on long-term growth
rather than short-term gains," Manu explains. This strategic
approach has allowed MSI to navigate economic downturns
and continue expanding its market reach.

MSI’s Achievements
Manu's success with MSI is underscored by impressive
numbers that demonstrate the company's impact. The
company's supply now in 2024. span 37+ countries, with
over 57 stocking yard and 7.5 Million Square Feet of

C u l t iva t i n g Fa i r ne s s i n
Business: The Cornerstone
of MSI’s Success
This chapter discusses how Manu and Rika made fairness in
business not only an ethical principle but also a key strate y that
fueled MSI's growth and reputation. Their commitment to fairness
shaped relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees,
fostering trust and long-term partnerships. A pivotal moment came
during a transaction in Vermont, where Manu learned the value of
fair pricing as essential for sustainable business relationships. This
approach extended to paying suppliers early, ensuring trust and
quality in their dealings. Their sons, Raj and Rup, further embedded
this fairness philosophy into MSI’s operations, strengthening the
company's global reputation and proving that ethical practices lead
to enduring success in business.

g

152

Learning and Practicing Fairness
The Vermont Incident
A pivotal moment in Manu’s understanding of fairness
occurred during a visit to a customer in Barre, Vermont, in
1980. This incident exempli es how fairness became a
foundational principle for MSI:
Manu was introducing a high-quality red granite from
India to Bert Rouleau, a potential buyer from Vermont.
Impressed by the sample, Bert issued a purchase order for
ve large blocks without mentioning the price. Caught up
in the excitement, Manu initially didn’t notice the omission.
Manu called up Rika to share the big news, and the rst
question Rika asked was “What will be our selling price?”
Manu just realized his oversight and ran up to Bert.

ro tability is often prioritized over fairness in the
business world. However, fairness in business
dealings is more than a moral choice; it is a strategic
approach that fosters long-term relationships and
sustainable success. For Manu and Rika, fairness was not
just a personal virtue but a principle they endeavored to
embed deeply within the culture of MSI. This chapter
explores how this commitment to fairness shaped the
company's interactions across all levels—from family
members to international partners—and how it has been a
driving force behind MSI’s reputation and growth.

When asked what the price should be, Bert’s response
became a life-long lesson for Manu in fairness: “Manu, be
fair to us; if you charge too much, you won't have us as a
customer. If you charge too little, you might be out of
business, and all the money we spend promoting this
granite will be wasted. Just be fair.” This interaction
profoundly in uenced Manu's business philosophy,
reinforcing that fairness must be the guiding principle in all
transactions.

Fairness as a Business Strate y
Manu’s takeaway from the Vermont encounter was clear—
fairness is not merely ethical; it's economical. This
principle guided MSI’s pricing strategies with big-box
retailers and other customers. Manu understood that fair
pricing ensured faster inventory turnover, which was more

g

pro table in the long run than high markups on slowermoving stock.

Extending Fairness Beyond Transactions
Under Manu’s leadership, MSI adopted a policy of paying
suppliers the day after a container was shipped, well before
the goods were received. This practice not only built
immense trust but also secured MSI’s supply lines, making
it a preferred business partner worldwide. A supplier once
questioned what would happen if substandard goods were
shipped since MSI paid upfront. Manu’s response
highlighted the ethos of MSI: “We might lose money on one
container, but you would lose a lifetime customer.” This
approach has ensured that MSI never received substandard
goods and never lost money due to unfair practices in its
supply chain.

Raj and Rup’s Expansion of the Fairness
Doctrine
Raj and Rup Shah, having observed their parents’
commitment to fairness, have not only continued this
legacy but also expanded it. They ensured that fairness
permeated all aspects of MSI’s operations, from employee
relations to customer engagements and international
dealings. Their leadership reinforced the idea that fairness
and trust are critical to global business success and are
essential for fostering a healthy, productive corporate
environment.

Conclusion: The Enduring Impact of Fairness
Fairness in business, as practiced by MSI, is a testament
to the belief that ethical practices lead to sustainable
success. This approach has helped MSI build and maintain
strong relationships across all levels of operation,
contributing to its reputation as a trustworthy and reliable
partner in the industry. The story of MSI’s commitment to
fairness serves as an inspiring model for businesses
worldwide, proving that success can be achieved without
compromising on core ethical values.
Fairness in business is a foundational principle that
signi cantly contributes to the growth and longevity of a
company. Treating suppliers, employees, and customers
with fairness builds trust, loyalty, and a positive reputation,
which are essential for sustainable success. Fair dealings
with suppliers ensure reliable partnerships and consistent
quality, reducing risks and fostering innovation through
collaborative e orts. Employees who experience fairness in
the workplace are more motivated, engaged, and loyal,
leading to higher productivity and lower turnover rates.
This positive work environment attracts top talent and
cultivates a culture of mutual respect and integrity.
Additionally, fair treatment of customers enhances
satisfaction, trust, and brand loyalty, encouraging repeat
business and positive word-of-mouth referrals. By
embedding fairness in all business practices, companies
can create a virtuous cycle of trust and growth, ensuring
long-term resilience and competitive advantage in the
marketplace.

digital biography, this chapter will highlight how MSI’s
ethical approach has not only shaped its corporate culture
but has also driven its success, making it a leader in the
industry.

Quotes:
Albert Einstein: "Try not to become a man of success.
Rather become a man of value."
Henry Ford: "Coming together is a beginning; keeping
together is progress; working together is success."
Historical Context
1. The Ethical Business Movement (Late 20th Century): During
the late 20th century, there was a growing awareness of the
importance of ethical business practices. This shift was partly a
response to high-pro le corporate scandals that damaged public
trust, such as the Enron scandal in 2001. Companies began to
realize that long-term success required a reputation for integrity
and fairness. MSI’s commitment to paying suppliers promptly and
building fair relationships re ects this broader historical trend of
prioritizing ethical business practices.
2. The Emergence of Global Supply Chains (1980s-2000s): As
businesses expanded globally, the complexity of supply chains
increased, and maintaining fair dealings with suppliers became a
competitive advantage. Manu Shah's approach to paying suppliers
early and treating them as partners aligns with the best practices of
successful global companies that emerged during this period,
demonstrating how fairness can enhance supply chain reliability
and foster long-term partnerships.

157

3. Fair Trade Movement: The Fair Trade movement gained
momentum in the late 20th century, advocating for fair wages,
ethical treatment of workers, and sustainable practices. While MSI
wasn't directly part of this movement, Manu's approach to ensuring
fairness in dealings with suppliers and customers re ects similar
principles, emphasizing that ethical practices contribute to business
sustainability and success.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Cultural Values of Fairness and Dharma: Manu Shah's
emphasis on fairness aligns with the Indian cultural concept of
"dharma," which emphasizes righteousness, fairness, and ethical
behavior. In Indian culture, business is not just about pro t but also
about adhering to principles of fairness and mutual respect, which
is evident in Manu's approach to treating customers, suppliers, and
employees with integrity.
2. The American Ethos of Fair Play: The commitment to fairness
in business also resonates with American cultural values, where
concepts like the "Golden Rule" ("Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you") are deeply embedded. MSI’s practices, such as
fair pricing and prompt payment, re ect this American ethos of fair
play, transparency, and mutual respect.
3. Family Business Values: In many family-owned businesses,
fairness and trust are integral to sustaining relationships and
ensuring longevity. Manu and Rika's approach to instilling fairness
in MSI's operations and the way Raj and Rup expanded this
principle re ects the values of many family-run enterprises that
emphasize treating all stakeholders—employees, customers, and
suppliers—as extended family members.

Leadership
This chapter highlights the dual nature of leadership,
emphasizing that it is both an inherent quality and a learned skill.
At MSI, Manu Shah, along with his sons Raj and Rup, cultivated a
leadership culture rooted in fairness, trust, and employee wellbeing. By prioritizing job security and ethical business practices,
they created a strong foundation for innovation and growth. The
ability to turn challenges into opportunities is central to MSI’s
leadership, with a focus on motivating teams and fostering
engagement through bold decision-making and adaptability.

159

he best estimates o ered by research suggest that
leadership is about one-third innate and two-thirds
developed through experience. This depends signi cantly
on how one de nes leadership. If we see leadership as a
skill that involves motivating and directing people—whether
in business, sports, or politics—then it is largely a set of
competencies acquired through experience, selfdevelopment, and training.

There is evidence that being bold, assertive, or risktaking can be advantageous for leaders. Leaders also need
to be intelligent to analyze situations and determine the
best courses of action. However, leadership is not just
about taking risks; it's also about creating an environment
where challenges can act as catalysts for growth and
innovation.

How to Create a Culture of Trust in Your Organization
Culture Shock: How to Maintain the Momentum of
Organizational Culture Change Post Crisis
To exemplify the importance of maintaining a dynamic
and challenging environment, consider the innovative
approach used by Japanese shermen, known for their love
of fresh sh. As the waters close to Japan became depleted,
shermen had to venture further, which led to longer trips
and less fresh sh. Initially, they tried freezing the sh at
sea, but the taste was noticeably di erent. They then
moved to storing sh in tanks, but the lack of movement
resulted in dull, less avorful sh.
The breakthrough came when they added a small shark
to the tank. The shark created a challenge, keeping the sh
active and thus maintaining their freshness. This story
parallels the workplace environment where, without
challenge s, te ams c an become complacent and
unproductive. The "shark" in this metaphor represents new
challenges that keep employees engaged and push them to
innovate and strive for excellence.
Have you realized that some of us are also living in a
pond but most of the time tired and dull ? Basically in our
lives, sharks are new challenges to keep us active. If you are
steadily conquering challenges, you are happy. Your
challenges keep you energized. Don’t create success and

Examples of Leadership at MSI
Commitment to Employee Well-being
Having spent his rst 17 years in the Midwest of America,
Manu witnessed the frequent layo s in the auto and
manufacturing industries. He saw rsthand the devastating
e ects of boom and bust cycles on the workforce. This
experience led him to make a pledge: MSI would not lay o
employees due to a lack of work. Manu believed that
employees were the best assets a company could have,
even if they didn't appear on the balance sheet. He coined
the phrase, "Your pain is our pain - your gain is our gain,"
embodying his belief that the company's success is
intrinsically linked to the well-being of its employees.
Avoiding Cash Transactions
Manu also took a strong stance against cash transactions,
which he likened to DUI for small businesses. He believed
that once hooked on cash transactions, it was not easy to
give them up, and they often led to legal violations for both
the giver and the taker. This principle has guided MSI in
maintaining ethical business practices and building a
reputation for integrity and transparency.

Learning from the Midwest Experience
The frequent mergers and acquisitions in the Midwest's
manufacturing sector added further burdens on ordinary
workers. Manu's leadership approach at MSI was in uenced
by these observations. He understood the instability and
fear that came with such corporate maneuvers and
resolved to create a stable and secure working environment
for MSI employees. This commitment is re ected in MSI’s
history of never laying o employees due to economic
downturns.
Encouraging Long-term Commitment
Manu’s philosophy also extended to fostering long-term
commitment from employees. By ensuring job security and
focusing on personal and professional growth, MSI has
nurtured a loyal workforce dedicated to the company's
success. This approach has been fundamental in building a
strong, cohesive team that works towards common goals.
The Role of Raj and Rup in Expanding Leadership
Principles
With the entry of Raj and Rup into the business, MSI’s
leadership principles were further strengthened. Their
fresh perspectives and innovative ideas led to the
implementation of new strategies that aligned with Manu's
core beliefs. Under their leadership, MSI has continued to
thrive, adapting to new challenges and opportunities with a
focus on sustainable growth and employee well-being.

Building Trust Through Challenges
Incorporating challenges in the workplace, similar to the
shark in the tank, can also be an e ective strate y for
building trust within an organization. Here are some
actionable steps to build trust through a challenging yet
supportive environment:
• Establish Clear Objectives and Roles: Ensure that
each team member knows what is expected of them and
how they contribute to the organization's goals. This
clarity can foster trust and a sense of security.
• Promote Open Communication: Encourage
employees to express their ideas, concerns, and feedback
openly. An environment where communication is valued
can help in mitigating misunderstandings and building
trust.
• Provide Support and Resources: While challenges
can stimulate activity and growth, it's crucial to also
provide the necessary support and resources to help
employees meet these challenges successfully.
• Recognize and Reward E orts: Acknowledging the
hard work and achievements of employees can build
trust and motivate them to maintain high performance.
Recognition can be as simple as verbal praise or as
signi cant as promotions and raises.
• Encourage Risk-Taking Within Safe Boundaries:
Allow employees to experiment and take risks within

g

ff

ff

fi

164

de ned limits. This can enhance innovation and trust in
leadership, as employees feel supported in exploring new
ideas.
• Facilitate Team Building Activities: Regular teambuilding activities that challenge employees can
strengthen relationships and build trust among team
members.
By fostering a culture that embraces challenges as
opportunities for growth, organizations can enhance their
trust quotient, leading to a more dynamic, innovative, and
productive workplace. The story of the shark in the tank
not only emphasizes the necessity of challenges but also
serves as a metaphor for the dynamic environments that
can lead to greater success in any organization.

Quotes:
John C. Maxwell: "A leader is one who knows the way,
goes the way, and shows the way."
This quote aligns with the idea that leadership is both an
inherent quality and a learned skill, as exempli ed by
Manu, Raj, and Rup Shah at MSI.
Peter Drucker: "Management is doing things right;
leadership is doing the right things."
This emphasizes the distinction between mere
management and true leadership, which focuses on ethical
practices, long-term vision, and the well-being of
employees.

165

Dwight D. Eisenhower: "Leadership is the art of getting
someone else to do something you want done because he
wants to do it."
This re ects the culture of motivating and engaging
employees at MSI, turning challenges into opportunities for
growth.
Helen Keller: "Alone we can do so little; together we can
do so much."
This quote highlights the importance of teamwork and
collaboration, resonating with the leadership philosophy at
MSI that fosters a culture of trust and unity.
Historical Context
1. The Shift in Leadership Styles (Late 20th to Early 21st
Century): Leadership styles evolved from authoritarian, top-down
approaches to more collaborative, empathetic, and employeecentric models. This shift mirrored the changing business
landscape, where companies realized that engaged, motivated, and
empowered employees were key to innovation and productivity.
MSI’s approach to leadership, emphasizing job security, fairness,
and employee well-being, aligns with this historical shift towards
more inclusive and ethical leadership practices.
2. The Decline of the Manufacturing Sector in the Midwest:
Manu Shah's experiences with frequent layo s in the Midwest
during the decline of the manufacturing sector in the late 20th
century in uenced his commitment to creating a stable and secure
workplace at MSI. This historical backdrop shaped MSI’s "no layo s"
policy, contrasting with the instability that plagued the
manufacturing industry during that period.

3. Adoption of Transformational Leadership (1980sPresent): Transformational leadership, characterized by inspiring
and motivating employees to exceed their own expectations, became
prominent in the business world during this era. MSI’s leadership
model, which involves inspiring employees to tackle challenges and
innovate, re ects this trend towards transformational leadership.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Leadership Values of "Seva" (Service) and
"Dharma" (Duty): Manu Shah's leadership principles are deeply
rooted in the Indian values of "seva" (sel ess service) and
"dharma" (duty). The emphasis on fairness, treating employees as
assets, and ethical business practices re ect these cultural ideals,
which prioritize serving others and ful lling one’s responsibilities
with integrity.
2. American Ideals of Self-Made Success and Ethical
Leadership: The leadership journey at MSI embodies American
values of self-made success, adaptability, and ethical conduct. By
establishing a culture of trust, transparency, and employee wellbeing, MSI re ects the American belief that true leadership is about
lifting others up and creating opportunities for collective success.
3. Family-Centric Leadership Approach: The involvement of
Raj and Rup in MSI's leadership represents the cultural tradition of
passing down leadership within a family business, a common
practice in many cultures, particularly within immigrant
communities. This approach emphasizes continuity, loyalty, and
the preservation of core values, which has been instrumental in
MSI’s growth and sustainability.

Embracing a Data-Driven
Culture: The Evolution of
Decision-Making at MSI
This chapter discusses MSI’s transformation into a data-driven
organization, a key factor in its success. Beginning in the 1990s with
a focus on rapid nancial reporting, Manu Shah implemented a
culture of fast, actionable data. Over time, this evolved into
sophisticated real-time data analytics, with MSI now utilizing the
ARCS model (Analysis, Recommendations, Conclusions, and
Suggestions) to drive operational e ciency and strategic decisionmaking. This journey from basic data use to advanced strategies has
enabled MSI to remain competitive and adaptable in a rapidly
changing market.

ffi

fi

168

rom its inception,
M S International,
Inc. (MSI) has
recognized the power of
data in driving business
decisions
and
operational e ciency.
Under the leadership of
Manu and his sons, Raj
and Rup, MSI has
continually advanced its
data
analytics
capabilities to enhance responsiveness and strategic
insight. This chapter details MSI's journey from using basic
data analytics in the 1990s to leveraging sophisticated datadriven strategies that today form the backbone of its
decision-making processes.

Early Adoption of Data Analytics
The 1990s and the Onset of Data Utilization
In the early 1990s, MSI understood the importance of
timely data analysis, especially around month-end nancial
closures. Manu Shah instituted a policy requiring monthend reports to be completed within one day to ensure that
data was fresh and actionable. This promptness in data
handling ensured that responsible associates could recall
details of transactions and operations, facilitating e ective
and immediate analysis and decision-making.

ff

fi

ffi

169

Advancements in Data Processing
Streamlining for Real-Time Analysis
Over the years, MSI has signi cantly reduced the time
needed for nancial closures from weeks to days to hours.
What once took a day now takes merely three hours, with
year-end nancials wrapped up in just a few additional
hours. This rapid data processing allows MSI to distribute
relevant data to all a ected areas promptly, ensuring that
each department can analyze results and performance in
near real-time.

Comprehensive Reporting Systems
Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Insights
MSI’s data ecosystem provides a plethora of reports and
alerts that reach all leaders daily, weekly, monthly,
quarterly, and annually. These reports include perspective
comparisons to historical data, daily averages, and other
critical metrics such as:
•
Revenue
•
Inventory levels
•
Accounts receivable collections
•
Performance by teams, warehouses, product lines,
shipping countries, container loads, dollar volume, and
weight.
MSI's re ned data-driven strategies facilitate not only
broad strategic insights but also operational improvements
that manifest in tangible bene ts. For instance,

fi

fi

fi

fi

fi

170

sophisticated inventory management systems, driven by
real-time data analytics, allow MSI to maintain optimal
stock levels, minimizing instances of overstocking or
stockouts. This precision in inventory management ensures
that MSI can meet customer demand more e ciently,
reduce holding costs, and improve cash ow. Furthermore,
the ability to analyze purchasing patterns and sales
forecasts with greater accuracy enables proactive
adjustments to production schedules and procurement
plans, enhancing overall operational agilit y and
responsiveness to market changes.
This extensive reporting structure supports a granular
level of analysis across all dimensions of the business,
facilitating detailed oversight and proactive management.

Analytical Frameworks and Continuous
Improvement
ARCS Driving Actions from Insights
The ARCS model (Analysis, Recommendations,
Conclusions, and Suggestions) at MSI exempli es how data
is transformed into actionable insights.
•
Analysis: This initial step involves a deep dive into
the raw data collected across various business operations.
Managers and analysts scrutinize the data to detect
patterns, anomalies, trends, and correlations. By examining
the data from multiple dimensions—such as time periods,
product lines, and geographic regions—the team can

ffi

fi

fl

—

171

understand the underlying dynamics of business
operations.
•
Recommendations: Based on the insights gained
from the analysis, the next step is to formulate strategic
recommendations. These are actionable proposals aimed at
exploiting opportunities or mitigating risks identi ed
during the analysis phase. Recommendations are expected
to be practical, grounded in data, and aligned with the
company's strategic objectives.
•
Conclusions: After formulating recommendations,
managers draw conclusions about the overall health and
trajectory of the business. This involves synthesizing the
data and insights into a coherent narrative that can be
understood and acted upon by senior leadership.
Conclusions often highlight the e cacy of current
strategies and validate or challenge existing business
assumptions.
•
Suggestions: The nal step involves suggesting
further actions that could be taken to enhance business
operations. This could include adjustments to existing
procedures, the introduction of new tools or technologies,
or even the recommendation for additional research or
data collection. Suggestions are aimed at fostering
continuous improvement and ensuring the business
remains agile and responsive to market demands.
The ARCS model not only ensures that MSI leverages data
comprehensively but also fosters a culture of informed
decision-making and continuous improvement, keeping the

fi

ffi

fi

172

organization strategically aligned and competitive in a fastevolving market.
This model encourages managers to not only analyze
data but also to make informed recommendations, draw
conclusions, and suggest further actions. This ongoing
cycle ensures continuous improvement and strategic
alignment across the organization.

Beyond the Numbers
Cultivating a Deeper Understanding
MSI fosters an environment where leaders are
encouraged to read "between the lines" of data reports and
graphs to uncover underlying trends and insights. The
mantra, "We know what we know; we don’t know what we
don’t know," prompts a culture of curiosity and continuous
learning, pushing teams to explore beyond the obvious and
consider what additional data might be needed for better
decision-making.

Conclusion: Data as a Pillar of MSI’s Success
Today, MSI’s commitment to being a data-driven
organization is deeply embedded in its culture and
operational practices. The company's ability to quickly
adapt and respond to market changes, optimize operations,
and strategically plan for the future is largely attributable to
its sophisticated use of data. This chapter not only
highlights the technical advancements in MSI's data
handling but also underscores the strategic mindset that
173

data fosters within the company, making it a formidable
player in the global market.

Historical Context
1. The Rise of Data Analytics in Business (1990s-Present): The
1990s marked a signi cant shift toward data-driven decisionmaking as companies began to recognize the power of data in
driving e ciency and competitiveness. This era saw the advent of
enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and business
intelligence tools, which allowed businesses to collect, analyze, and
utilize data more e ectively. MSI's early adoption of rapid nancial
reporting and eventual implementation of sophisticated data
analytics mirrors this broader historical trend, positioning the
company as a forward-thinking, data-driven organization.
2. The Digital Revolution and Big Data (2000s-Present): With
the explosion of the internet, mobile technolo y, and social media in
the 2000s, the concept of "big data" emerged, fundamentally
altering how companies gathered and analyzed information. MSI’s
evolution into a real-time data-driven enterprise aligns with this
shift, demonstrating how leveraging big data and advanced
analytics has become essential for staying competitive in modern

showcasing how data analytics can enhance operational e ciency
and strategic decision-making.
Cultural Context
1. The American Emphasis on Innovation and E ciency: The
adoption of a data-driven culture at MSI aligns with the American
business ethos of innovation, e ciency, and the pursuit of
excellence. American companies have historically prioritized
leveraging technolo y and data to gain a competitive edge, and
MSI’s journey mirrors this cultural commitment to staying ahead
through informed, data-backed decisions.
2. Indian Cultural Values of Continuous Learning and
Adaptability: Manu Shah's insistence on using data to drive
decisions re ects the Indian cultural value of "vidya," or the pursuit
of knowledge. In many Indian traditions, continuous learning and
adaptability are viewed as pathways to growth and success. MSI's
data-driven culture embodies this ethos by encouraging curiosity,
ongoing learning, and the use of data to adapt to changing market
conditions.
3. Globalization and Cross-Cultural Management: As MSI
operates in multiple countries, the use of data-driven practices has
helped bridge cultural di erences, ensuring that decisions are based
on objective insights rather than assumptions or biases. This
approach aligns with the global trend of using data to facilitate
cross-cultural understanding and collaboration in multinational
organizations.

Prudent Financial
Management - The Keystone
of MSI's Stability and
Growth
This chapter discusses how MSI’s nancial management, since its
founding in 1975, has been guided by strict discipline and selfreliance, principles instilled by Rika Shah. Early policies such as
avoiding external capital and ensuring timely payments laid the
groundwork for MSI’s nancial stability. Raj and Rup Shah
continued this approach, focusing on conservative growth and
implementing key strategies like the "No Budget" policy and securing
employee well-being during economic downturns. These practices
have allowed MSI to grow sustainably and navigate market
volatility e ectively.

fi

fi

ff

176

inancial prudence has been a cornerstone of M S
International, Inc. (MSI) since its inception in 1975.
Founded by Manu and Rika with a modest initial revenue
and virtually no external capital, MSI's nancial strategies
have been pivotal in
sustaining and scaling its
operations. This chapter
delves into the
foundational nancial
principles established by
Rika, the strategic
continuation by their
sons Raj and Rup, and
the innovative nancial
management practices
that have driven MSI's
growth and stability.

The Foundations of Financial Discipline
From the very beginning, Rika instilled a strict nancial
discipline within MSI, emphasizing the importance of selfreliance and cautious growth. The policy of not borrowing
money from anyone except banks was a critical decision
that ensured MSI maintained control over its nances and
operations. This approach was complemented by a
rigorous auditing process, with the bank performing audits
three times a year at Rika’s insistence, ensuring
transparency and accountability in MSI’s nancial dealings.

177

The Philosophy of Conservative Growth
As MSI grew, the need for capital increased. However,
Manu and Rika, supported later by Raj and Rup, were
cautious about leveraging external capital. They preferred
bank loans secured against accounts receivable and
inventory, which were deemed safer and kept the
company's nancial health in check. Raj and Rup, during
their time at Wharton Business School, reinforced these
principles, advising against reliance on external capital
(Manu jokingly refers it as OPM - Other People's Money) and
instead focusing on maintaining su cient savings and
controlled growth. Treat OPM as Opium Drug once hooked
on di cult to be free from OPM.

Internal Financial Policies and Practices
Rika’s Rules and Financial Integrity
Rika’s rule that "Sales is not a sale until it’s paid" shaped
MSI’s approach to revenue recognition, emphasizing the
importance of actual cash in ows over booked revenue.
This was mirrored in her insistence on timely payments to
vendors, establishing a reciprocal expectation of prompt
payments from MSI's customers. This practice not only
secured MSI’s cash ows but also built trust and reliability
with suppliers and customers alike.

ffi

fl

fl

fi

ffi

178

The Unique Approach to Budgeting
Drawing from Manu’s frustrating experiences with
restrictive corporate budgeting practices at International
Trucks, MSI adopted a ‘No Budget’ policy. This
unconventional approach means that there are no xed
annual budgets for departments; spending is based on
immediate needs and strategic priorities rather than pre-set
limits. This exibility allows MSI to remain agile and
responsive to market conditions and opportunities.

Financial Stability and Employee Security
Cash ow is a critical measure at MSI, but it is not the
sole focus. The company prioritizes maintaining a payroll
structure that adjusts responsively to revenue uctuations,
ensuring nancial stability without compromising
employee security. Raj, Rup and MSI’s VP of Finance’s
enhanced including cash ow. MSI became even more ready
economic downtowns and when downtowns came, they
were ready for it with all possible solutions. This approach
has been crucial for MSI in navigating and succeeding
during recessions, allowing MSI to avoid layo s and even
capture increased market share as competitors struggle.

Conclusion: Sustaining Growth Through
Financial Acumen
MSI’s nancial strategies—characterized by rigorous
discipline, strategic growth management, and innovative
practices like the ‘No Budget’ policy—have not only fueled
its expansion but also cushioned it against economic
volatilities. These practices re ect a deep understanding of
the nuances of nancial management in a global business
environment and underscore the Shah family ’s
commitment to long-term stability and employee welfare.
This chapter not only highlights the nancial principles
that have underpinned MSI's success but also serves as a
blueprint for other businesses striving to balance growth
with nancial health in challenging economic landscapes.

2. Bank Audits and Transparency (1970s-Present): The
insistence on regular bank audits, a practice implemented by Rika
Shah, aligns with the growing global emphasis on nancial
transparency and regulatory compliance. During the 1970s, stricter
nancial reporting standards emerged in response to nancial
crises and corporate collapses, leading to more robust auditing
practices. MSI’s commitment to transparency and rigorous nancial
oversight demonstrates the company’s alignment with this broader
move toward nancial integrity.
3. The “No Budget” Approach in the Context of Lean
Management (1980s-Present): MSI’s adoption of a ‘No Budget’
policy, emphasizing exibility in spending based on immediate
needs, mirrors the rise of lean management principles in the late
20th century. Lean management, which focuses on reducing waste
and increasing e ciency, encourages exibility and responsiveness,
much like MSI’s nancial strate y of adjusting spending
dynamically rather than being constrained by rigid budgets.
4. The 2008 Financial Crisis and Preparedness: MSI's focus on
cash ow management and employee security proved particularly
prescient during economic downturns like the 2008 nancial crisis.
Many companies, particularly those with heavy reliance on debt
and external capital, struggled to maintain operations during this
period. MSI’s approach of maintaining nancial discipline and
being ready for economic downturns allowed it to navigate these
challenges successfully and even capture market share as
competitors faltered.

nancial management. Following the Great Depression and World
War II, many businesses adopted cautious growth strategies,
emphasizing savings, avoiding debt, and building nancial selfreliance. MSI’s emphasis on not relying on external capital and the
careful management of cash ows mirror these broader historical
trends, where companies sought nancial independence as a means
of ensuring long-term stability.

1. Indian Cultural Values of Self-Reliance and Financial
Discipline: The nancial management strategies employed at MSI
re ect deeply ingrained Indian values of self-reliance and cautious
nancial stewardship. The emphasis on avoiding external capital
and managing nances conservatively aligns with traditional Indian
cultural beliefs that promote living within one’s means, avoiding
unnecessary debt, and being nancially independent.
2. The American Dream of Financial Independence: MSI’s
nancial practices also resonate with the broader American ethos of
self-made success and nancial independence. The reluctance to rely
on “Other People’s Money” (OPM), as highlighted in the chapter,
aligns with the American ideal of achieving success through one’s
own e orts and resources, avoiding nancial entanglements that
could compromise autonomy.
3. Family-Run Business Ethics: MSI’s nancial strategies,
including the prioritization of employee security and stability,
re ect the ethical principles often associated with family-run
businesses. Family enterprises, particularly in Indian and
immigrant communities, frequently emphasize nancial prudence,
long-term stability, and the well-being of employees, treating them
as extended family members.

Failure is the Best Coach
This chapter discusses Manu Shah's belief that failure is a
learning tool, not an endpoint, and the importance of taking
calculated risks supported by safety nets. Throughout MSI's growth,
from its founding to signi cant projects like the Vietnam War
Memorial, Manu and Rika relied on these safety measures to pursue
bold initiatives while protecting the company’s foundation. MSI’s
success is also rooted in nancial prudence, treating safety nets as
essential to balance risks, ensure growth, and maintain long-term
stability.

fi

fi

ear of failure is one of the most signi cant barriers to
innovation and growth. Fear of failure often holds
people back from taking risks, but Manu believes that
failure doesn't truly exist—it's merely a learning tool
when you have a safety net in place.
Throughout Manu and Rika's life, they consistently
relied on safety nets to mitigate risks while pursuing
ambitious goals.
Manu Shah rmly believes that failure is not an endpoint
but a valuable learning tool—provided there is a safety net
in place. Whether it was starting MSI from their home while
Manu kept his day job, or tackling the high-stakes project of
supplying black granite for the Vietnam War Memorial,
safety nets provided the security they needed to take bold
steps. These experiences reinforced Manu's belief that
calculated risks, supported by a solid safety net, lead to
growth and success. This chapter delves into how the right
safety nets have allowed Manu and Rika to take calculated
risks throughout their lives, leading to growth and a fun
journey.

Starting a Business with a Safety Net
When Manu and Rika started their business from their
home, Manu kept his full-time job as a safety net. This
decision proved invaluable, particularly during the riskiest
and most de ning moments in MSI's early history. One such
instance was the opportunity to supply black granite for the
Vietnam War Memorial. The order was monumental
compared to MSI’s size at the time, fraught with challenges

fi

fi

fi

184

such as geopolitical
issues,
the
requirement of large 11foot long black granite
blocks
from
unmechanized
quarries in India,
Transportation of
25 30 tons heavy
blocks (Unable to
containerized at that
time) and strained
relations between the
U.S. and India. There was no margin for error, and the
safety net of Manu's job provided the necessary security to
take on this daunting challenge.

Lessons from Business Acquisitions
In 1992, Manu acquired a business to accelerate MSI’s
growth. However, he ensured that the acquisition was kept
separate from MSI, safeguarding the company and its
workforce in case the venture failed. By 1994, Manu
decided to exit the acquired business, having learned
critical lessons without jeopardizing MSI.
Similarly, in 1996, Manu acquired another business,
merging its assets, inventory, and sta with MSI. Yet, when
the principal partners left due to di ering core values, the
lessons learned reinforced the importance of aligning any
acquisition with MSI’s core values. Throughout these
ventures, the main business and key personnel of MSI were

ff

ff

-

185

preserved as the safety net, ensuring that the company's
foundation remained strong despite the risks taken.

Safety Nets in Everyday Learning
Manu’s belief in the importance of safety nets extends
beyond business. He often compares the learning process
to a child learning to crawl, walk, or ride a bicycle. In each
of these scenarios, a safety net—whether it’s a soft landing
for a baby learning to stand, training wheels on a bicycle,
or a life jacket while learning to swim—provides the security
needed to take risks and learn from failures. Parents rejoice
in their child’s progress, understanding that the safety net
is what allows them to take those rst steps without fear of
irreversible harm. Message from Manu Take risk with Safety
net, Keep learning!

The Circus: Walking the High Wire with
Con dence
An inspiring example of
how safety nets enable
risk-taking can be seen
in the circus. A
performer walking on a
wire rope or bicycling
80 feet high, hands-free,
does so with the
knowledge that a safety
net is positioned 20 feet
below to catch them if
they fall. This safety net

fi

fi

186

doesn’t diminish the di culty of the act but allows the
performer to push the boundaries of what is possible
without the fear of catastrophic failure. The same principle
applies in business and life—having a safety net allows
individuals to take bold risks, innovate, and achieve
extraordinary feats.

The Strategic Use of Safety Nets in Expansion
and Innovation
Manu strategically employed safety nets in various
aspects of business, ensuring that risks were carefully
managed. Whether it was opening a new branch,
appointing a leader, launching a new product line,
securing an anchor customer, entering a ne w
geographical region, or selecting suppliers from di erent
countries, safety nets were always in place to protect
MSI's core operations. Manu also encouraged Raj, Rup,
and key employees to embrace calculated risks, knowing
that these safety nets would provide the necessary
support to navigate any challenges that arose. This
approach not only safeguarded the company but also
fostered a culture of innovation and growth.

Financial Strength and Cost Control
The Ultimate Safety Net for Recession
Manu's philosophy extended beyond operational risks to
encompass nancial management, particularly in preparing
for economic downturns. He believed that nancial
strength and rigorous cost control during prosperous times

ff

fi

ffi

fi

187

During good times, Manu ensured that the company’s
nancial practices were conservative, avoiding unnecessary
expenses and focusing on building a solid nancial
foundation. This approach allowed MSI to accumulate a
nancial cushion that could be drawn upon during
recessions, ensuring continuity and stability. When
economic downturns hit, MSI was not only able to sustain
operations but also seize opportunities that competitors,
less prepared and nancially strained, were forced to forgo.
This nancial prudence provided the safety net that
allowed MSI to continue its growth trajectory even in the
face of economic adversity.
Encouraging Risk-Taking with Safety Nets
Understanding that innovation and growth require a
willingness to take risks, Manu actively encouraged Raj,
Rup, and key employees to pursue new opportunities while
ensuring that safety nets were in place. This culture of
calculated risk-taking led to signi cant advancements for
MSI, such as expanding into new markets, establishing key
supplier relationships, and developing new product lines.
Manu’s guidance ensured that even when risks were taken,
the potential downsides were limited, allowing the
c o m p a ny to c o n t i nu a l ly m ove fo r wa rd w i t h ou t
compromising its core operations. This philosophy of
balancing bold moves with protective measures has been a

fi

served as the ultimate safety net during recessions. By
maintaining a strong balance sheet, building up reserves,
and practicing disciplined spending, MSI was able to
weather economic storms without resorting to layo s or
compromising on strategic initiatives.

cornerstone of MSI’s success, enabling the company to
navigate complex challenges while maintaining stability
and growth.
The Dangers of Bureaucracy as a Safety Net
While Manu values safety nets, he is wary of how they
can be misused in business. As companies grow,
bureaucracy often becomes a safety net that sti es
innovation and risk-taking. Manu observed that in large
organizations, decisions can be delayed by endless
approvals and the need for consensus, ultimately leading to
timely inaction. The worst misuse of a safety net, according
to Manu, is using it to avoid responsibility or to blame
others when things go wrong.
Conclusion: The Balance Between Risk and Security
Manu’s life and business philosophy revolve around the
understanding that risk is inherent in any signi cant
endeavor. However, by having well-thought-out safety nets,
one can take calculated risks and learn from failures
without jeopardizing the entire venture. Whether in
business or life, the ability to learn and grow from failures
while safeguarding what matters most is the key to longterm success.

Historical Context
1. The Concept of Risk Management in Business (1970sPresent): As businesses expanded globally, the importance of risk
management became more pronounced, especially after economic
downturns like the oil crisis in the 1970s, the 2008 nancial crisis,
and more recently, the COVID 19 pandemic. Companies that
successfully navigated these crises often did so by having strong
safety nets—such as diversi ed revenue streams, solid cash reserves,
or contingency plans. MSI’s approach of taking calculated risks with
safety nets mirrors this broader historical trend, where
organizations learned that proactive risk management is crucial for
survival and growth.
2. Entrepreneurial Resilience and Adaptability: Manu Shah's
belief in learning from failure re ects a historical understanding of
entrepreneurial success. Notable gures like Thomas Edison and
Henry Ford faced multiple setbacks before achieving success,
demonstrating that resilience and the ability to learn from failure
are essential components of entrepreneurship. MSI's philosophy of
embracing calculated risks while having safety nets aligns with this
historical narrative of entrepreneurial tenacity.
3. Vietnam War Memorial Project (1980s): Supplying black
granite for the Vietnam War Memorial was a high-risk endeavor
that became a pivotal moment in MSI's history. This project took
place during a time when relationships between the United States
and India were complex, and the logistics of transporting such
heavy materials were challenging. MSI’s success in this project,
backed by safety nets, exempli es the importance of managing risks
while pursuing ambitious goals.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Cultural Values of Prudence and Preparedness:
The concept of balancing risk with safety nets is deeply rooted in
Indian culture, where proverbs such as "Savdhani hati, durghatna

fi

fi

-

fl

fi

fi

190

ghati" (Caution removed, accidents happen) emphasize the
importance of being prepared. Manu Shah’s approach to taking
risks with the assurance of safety nets re ects this cultural emphasis
on prudence and preparedness, ensuring that even ambitious
endeavors are undertaken with caution.
2. The American Spirit of Innovation and Risk-Taking: The
idea of taking risks to achieve greatness is central to the American
ethos. The "pioneering spirit" that de nes American culture
encourages bold moves and innovation, but also values strategies
that mitigate potential losses. MSI’s ability to innovate and expand
while maintaining safety nets aligns with this cultural narrative of
balancing ambition with practical safeguards.
3. Parental Analogies and Learning: Manu’s comparison of
business risks to a child learning to walk or ride a bicycle with safety
nets re ects a universal cultural perspective on learning and
growth. In many cultures, parents encourage their children to take
risks within safe boundaries, understanding that failure is part of
the learning process. This analo y resonates with the broader idea
that growth, whether personal or professional, requires taking risks
but with mechanisms in place to prevent irreversible damage.

Staying Ahead
Competition

of

This chapter highlights how competition has been a driving force
behind MSI's success, propelling the company to innovate and turn
challenges into opportunities. Manu Shah sees competition as a
learning tool that fosters resilience and drives ambitious goals. By
strategically positioning itself, such as staying under the radar in
crowded markets, and adopting technological advancements like
digital printing on tiles and quartz countertops, MSI has capitalized
on competition to expand its reach, strengthen its brand, and
remain ahead in competitive markets, making it essential for
growth and innovation.

of
the
competition has always been
about strategic positioning,
continuous innovation, and
e m b r a c i n g c h a l l e n ge s a s
opportunities. "Competition is
like an enemy you must
outsmart," he often says. At
MSI, this mindset meant not
just keeping up with industry standards but setting new
ones, always striving to be among the top three in any
market or region they entered. This chapter explores how
competition played a pivotal role in transforming MSI from
a niche player into a dominant force in the natural stone
market, particularly in the United States.

Embracing Competition as a Learning
Experience
Competition extends beyond the binary outcomes of
winning or losing; it encompasses a wealth of lessons that
shape future strategies and personal growth. For Manu
Shah, competition has always been an opportunity to
analyze mistakes, re ne strategies, and learn how to
navigate setbacks gracefully. The true value of competition
lies in its ability to serve as a coach, providing crucial
insights and fostering resilience. Even when MSI faced
challenges or failed to secure a win, Manu viewed these
experiences as integral to long-term success. He believed
that each failure, including the failure to win, o ered

ff

fi

193

valuable lessons for future endeavors. This perspective
underscores the importance of not just striving for victory
but also embracing the lessons learned from defeat,
adapting strategies, and moving forward with renewed
determination. For Manu, the ability to learn from
competition and persevere through setbacks is a
fundamental aspect of entrepreneurial growth and success.

Competition: Knowing When to Remain Under
the Radar
Strategic Silence in the Face of Competition
In the realm of business competition, there are times when
it's strategic to remain under the radar. Manu Shah, starting
as youngest kid stayed away from getting parents attention.
Throughout his entrepreneurial journey, understood the
importance of not always being in the spotlight,
particularly in highly competitive markets. This approach is
akin to a student who remains humble, avoids unnecessary
attention, and focuses on genuine learning and growth
rather than seeking to outshine peers through super cial
means. Similarly, in the business world, staying under the
radar can provide a competitive edge by allowing a
company to operate without drawing undue attention from
competitors, thus avoiding potential con icts and strategic
counteractions.

The MSI Strate y: Focused Expansion and
Avoiding Direct Confrontation
In the early days of MSI’s expansion, particularly during
its signi cant presence in Tile Mile area of Anaheim,
California—a hub with over 40 competitors in the tile
industry—Manu and his team adopted a strategic approach
to remain under the radar. Rather than engaging in a direct
contest with so many established players, MSI chose to
concentrate its e orts on other major markets such as Salt
Lake City, Portland, Seattle, Denver, Chicago, and Dallas.
This strate y allowed MSI to capture a much larger share of
the market in tiles and slabs, leveraging purchasing power
and building substantial volume without getting entangled
in a high-stakes battle with local competitors.
This approach requires strategic thinking and awless
execution. By avoiding direct confrontation in saturated
markets, MSI was able to focus on expanding its reach in
less crowded areas. This not only enabled MSI to establish a
strong market presence but also to bene t from predictable
delivery and streamlined operations. The decision to stay
under the radar in certain competitive landscapes allowed
MSI to build its market share e ectively and e ciently,
proving that sometimes strategic restraint can lead to
signi cant advantages.

Historical Context and Strategic Implications
The concept of remaining under the radar is not new and
has been observed in various elds. In historical contexts,
leaders and military strategists often employed similar

ffi

fl

fi

ff

fi

g

ff

g

fi

fi

195

tactics to avoid direct con ict with stronger adversaries
while consolidating their own power. In the business world,
this strate y involves careful planning and execution,
ensuring that a company can grow and thrive without
unnecessary exposure to competitive pressures.
By choosing to focus on less competitive markets while
avoiding direct confrontation in heavily contested areas,
MSI exempli ed the strategic advantage of operating
discreetly. This approach not only allowed for sustainable
growth but also provided a competitive edge in the long
run. The ability to navigate complex market dynamics
while remaining strategically under the radar is a testament
to the e ectiveness of thoughtful and restrained business
tactics.

Quote for Re ection
"In the dance of competition, sometimes the most
powerful move is the one you don’t make. Strategic
restraint can be as e ective as bold action, allowing you to
grow and thrive in markets where others may falter."

The Importance of Market Positioning
Manu’s strate y was clear: aggressive goal-setting and
relentless pursuit of excellence. When MSI entered the
monuments market in 1984, Manu set the ambitious target
of becoming one of the top three players by 1986. "By
setting these ambitious targets, we ensured that our team
was always pushing forward," he explains. This goal-driven

fl

ff

fl

g

fi

g

ff

196

approach kept MSI focused and driven, enabling it to carve
out a signi cant market share quickly.

Leveraging Technolo y for Competitive
Advantage
Innovation and early adoption of technolo y were crucial
in maintaining MSI’s competitive edge. In the 1980s, MSI
was among the rst companies to use fax machines for
rapid communication, a move that dramatically reduced
communication time from over a week to just one day.
Manu’s forward-thinking didn’t stop there. By 1996, MSI
had embraced digital cameras for transferring design and
stone images e ciently, further speeding up business
processes. The company distributed up to ten Sony Mavica
digital cameras, using oppy disks, to suppliers, sales
associates, and customers, bringing them into the digital
world ahead of the curve.
The introduction of the IBM PC in 1981 and spreadsheet
software like SuperCalc and later Microsoft Excel
revolutionized MSI’s data management, enabling faster
response times to market demands and more e ective
supply chain management. "Technolo y enabled us to
respond faster to market demands and manage our supply
chain more e ectively," Manu adds. This technological
foresight was not just about keeping up—it was about
leading the way.

Innovation Beyond Technolo y
Innovation at MSI wasn’t just about adopting new
technologies; it was about continuously improving every
aspect of the business. Manu fostered a culture of relentless
improvement, where "we always looked for ways to do
things better." For instance, the introduction of the digital
fax machine with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in
the mid-2000s revolutionized order processing, allowing
MSI to outperform competitors in speed and accuracy.
MSI’s innovation extended to its product o erings as
well. Diversifying its product lines to include quartz and
luxury vinyl tile (LVT) allowed MSI to stay ahead of market
trends, expand its reach, and mitigate risks associated with
relying on a single product line. This diversi cation not
only expanded MSI's market reach but also mitigated risks
associated with relying on a single product line, ensuring
the company’s adaptability in a rapidly changing market
landscape.

The Vital Role of Competition in Growth
Competition is often perceived as a threat in the business
world, but for Manu, it was a necessity—a vital force for
innovation and growth. When Manu introduced black
granite countertops to the U.S. market between 1984 and
1986, he faced resistance. The concept of using black in
home interiors was new and somewhat unique, unlike
anything American homeowners were accustomed to. The

fi

ff

g

198

market was dominated by materials like Formica and
ceramic tiles, which were familiar and widely accepted.
The turning point came when competitors from Italy and
India began to enter the market with black granite
countertops. As more companies introduced this material,
it started gaining traction among homeowners. Suddenly,
what was once considered exotic became a desirable
showpiece in homes. The competition led to increased
volume, innovations in quarrying and production, and the
advent of containerized cargo, all of which helped to lower
prices and improve availability. Manu quickly realized that
competition was not something to fear but to embrace. It
was competition that helped black granite countertops
become a staple in American homes.
This pattern repeated itself across other product lines.
Between 1987 and 1995, Manu introduced multicolor slates
into the American market. Initially, it was a struggle, but as
more competitors joined the fray, these slates found their
place in homes across the country. The introduction of
travertine from Mexico and Ecuador in 1994 faced a similar
trajectory, but once travertine from Turkey entered the
market, erce competition drove it to become a ooring
staple in American homes. Similarly, Brazil’s Uba Tuba
granite, initially facing tough competition, ultimately
became a go-to material for countertops.

Global Lessons: The Grand Bazaar and Beyond
Manu’s belief in the power of competition was further
solidi ed during a visit to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. The
Bazaar, a bustling hub of commerce with around 4,000

fl

fi

fi

199

shops, exempli ed how competition drives innovation and
growth. Each shop, despite selling similar products, thrived
by nding unique ways to stand out. Manu observed that
competition didn’t just spur businesses to improve; it
fostered collaboration and mutual success among
merchants. This experience rea rmed his conviction that
competition is not something to fear but to embrace.
The lesson Manu gleaned from the Grand Bazaar was that
competition, far from being detrimental, was essential for
driving innovation and fostering growth. Competition
creates an environment where merchants are compelled to
innovate, improve their products, and enhance the
customer experience to stand out. At the same time,
competition drives down prices and increases demand,
ultimately bene ting both businesses and consumers.

Building a Strong Brand Through Competition
Staying ahead of the competition also involved building a
strong brand. "Our brand represented quality and
reliability," Manu states. This reputation was built over
years of consistent performance and customer satisfaction.
MSI’s commitment to quality ensured that every product
met the highest standards, a factor that was critical in
maintaining its competitive edge.
Marketing played a crucial role in establishing MSI’s
brand recognition. Manu invested in various marketing
strategies, from traditional advertising to participating in
trade shows and industry events, to ensure that MSI was
the go-to brand in every market it entered.

Digital Printing on Porcelain Tiles: The
Competitive Advantage
The story repeated once again with the introduction of
digital printing technolo y on porcelain oor and wall tiles
starting in 2007. Initially, this technolo y was met with
skepticism as traditional methods were deeply entrenched
in the market. However, as more competitors adopted
digital printing, the technolo y began to revolutionize the
industry. The ability to create intricate designs with high
precision made porcelain tiles more attractive and
versatile, driving consumer demand. MSI capitalized on
this trend, embracing the competition and pushing the
boundaries of what digital printing could achieve.

Quartz Countertops: A New Frontier in the
Market
From 2010 onwards, the quartz countertop market
experienced a similar transformation. Initially, quartz was
seen as a premium product with limited appeal. However,
as competitors began to o er a wider variety of quartz
surfaces at competitive prices, the material quickly gained
popularity. The durability, low maintenance, and aesthetic
appeal of quartz made it a preferred choice for
homeowners and designers alike. MSI’s early entry into this
competitive market allowed it to establish itself as a leader,
o ering a broad range of options that met the evolving
tastes and needs of consumers.

LVT - Luxury Vinyl Tiles: Competing in a
Crowded Market
The introduction of Luxury Vinyl Tiles (LVT) in 2014 was
yet another instance where competition played a crucial
role in market development. Initially, LVT was viewed as a
low-end alternative to traditional ooring options.
However, as more companies began to produce highquality LVT with advanced designs and textures, the
market perception shifted. LVT became known for its
durability, a ordability, and ease of installation, making it a
popular choice for both residential and commercial spaces.
MSI’s competitive pricing, combined with a commitment to
quality, helped it capture a signi cant market share in the
burgeoning LVT industry.
Manu’s philosophy became clear: competition is as
integral to business success as apple pie and motherhood
are to American culture. It drives companies to innovate,
improves product availability, lowers prices, and ultimately
bene ts the consumer. Without competition, the natural
stone market would have remained stagnant, and MSI
might never have achieved the success it enjoys today.

Conclusion: The Necessity of Competition
In conclusion, competition is not just important; it is
essential for growth and innovation. Manu Shah’s journey
with MSI is a testament to how embracing competition can
lead to remarkable success. By welcoming competition and

fl

using it as a catalyst for improvement, businesses can
achieve levels of growth and market penetration that would
otherwise be impossible. Competition ensures that
products evolve, markets expand, and consumers have
access to better options. It’s a vital ingredient in the recipe
for long-term success in any industry.
"Competition isn't just a challenge—it’s the spark that
ignites innovation and drives progress. Embrace it and
watch your business soar," Manu advises. In summary,

staying ahead of competitors aligns with this historical trend of
businesses needing to be agile and innovative to remain competitive
in a globalized economy.
2. Technological Advancements in the 1980s and 1990s: The
introduction of technologies like fax machines, digital cameras, and
the IBM PC revolutionized how businesses operated. MSI’s early
adoption of these technologies, which gave them a competitive
advantage, mirrors how technolo y became a di erentiating factor
for companies during this era. The company’s embrace of digital
printing on porcelain tiles and quartz countertops re ects the
broader shift towards digital transformation that took place in
many industries.
3. The Concept of Market Positioning and Blue Ocean Strate y:
MSI’s approach of entering less crowded markets and avoiding
direct competition re ects the principles of the "Blue Ocean
Strate y," which emphasizes nding untapped market spaces rather
than competing in saturated ones. This strate y became popular in
the business world around the early 2000s, and MSI’s application of
it in earlier decades highlights its forward-thinking approach.
Cultural Context
1. American Ideals of Competition and Innovation: The
emphasis on competition as a driver of innovation is deeply rooted
in American culture. The idea that "competition brings out the best"
is a common American ethos, encouraging businesses to continually
improve and innovate. MSI's ability to embrace competition, learn
from it, and use it as a catalyst for growth aligns with this cultural
belief that competition is essential for progress and success.
2. Indian Cultural Values of Adaptability and Strategic
Thinking: Manu Shah’s strategic decision to remain "under the
radar" in certain markets echoes Indian cultural values of
adaptability, patience, and strategic thinking. In Indian culture, it’s

instead focusing on steady growth and nding unique paths to
success. This approach allowed MSI to build strength and expand
without unnecessary exposure to competitive pressures.
3. The Bazaar Mentality and Co-opetition: Manu’s experience at
the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, where thousands of shops compete
yet coexist, embodies the concept of "co-opetition" (cooperative
competition). This mentality is prevalent in many Asian and Middle
Eastern cultures, where businesses compete but also recognize that
their collective presence bene ts the overall market. MSI’s approach
of learning from competitors and using competition to drive growth
re ects this cultural understanding of thriving in a shared market
space.

Strategic Thinking
This chapter underscores the critical role of strategic thinking in
MSI's success, focusing on proactive decision-making, resource
optimization, and goal-setting. Manu Shah's early decision to adopt
an importer-distributor model over manufacturing positioned MSI
for long-term growth in a global market. The chapter delves into
various levels of thinking, from self-awareness to innovation, while
highlighting the importance of aligning strategic thinking with
actionable steps. Key decisions, such as expanding product lines

thinking about how to
proactively accomplish
objectives rather than merely
reacting to existing
conditions. A strategic
mindset encourages
determining the best use of
resources and aligning them
with an action plan. In this
chapter, we will explore various aspects of thinking:
critical, focused, and strategic. Additionally, we'll examine
the importance of connecting strategic thinking with
strategic acting.

Why Think at All?
Strategic thinking is the ability to see the entire
enterprise, spot trends, understand the competitive
landscape, and lead the business into the future. It involves
using one's mind to consider or reason about something.
Finding time to engage in focused thinking is crucial for
e ective leadership and decision-making.

Levels of Thinking
John Maxwell, author of "How Successful People Think,"
lists several bene ts of what he calls “focused” thinking:
• Harnessing ener y toward a desired goal
• Giving ideas time to develop

g

ff

207

• Bringing clarity to the target
• Getting to the next level

Strategic thinking involves di erent levels:
• Level 1: Self-awareness, critical thinking, intellectual
curiosity, and openness.
• Level 2: Exercising good judgment, problem-solving,
decision-making, business acumen, and customer focus.
• Level 3: Successfully creating new and di erent
solutions, dealing with ambiguity, managing innovation,
and perspective thinking.

Shaping MSI's Journey
Early In uences on Strategic Thinking
Manu Shah's early career in manufacturing provided him
with invaluable insights into the complexities of the
industry. Working at Truck Mounted Crane in Cleveland
and International Trucks in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from the
late 70s through 1982, Manu witnessed rsthand the
perennial con icts between manufacturing and sales
departments. Sales departments aimed to meet market
demands, while manufacturing struggled to keep up, often
burdened by labor issues and slow adoption of new
technologies. The in ux of products from Europe and
Japan further complicated the landscape, highlighting the
ine ciencies and slow pace of domestic manufacturing.
Manu realized that in the rapidly changing world, being
an importer and distributor, rather than a manufacturer,

ff

208

provided a strategic advantage. Recognizing the strategic
shift, Manu decided that becoming an importer and
distributor was the right choice for the new world
economy. This insight led to MSI's strategic decision to
focus on distribution and logistics, setting the foundation
for the company's future growth.
Examples of Strategic Decisions
• Adopting the Distributor/Importer Model: Manu’s
decision to pivot from manufacturing to importing and
distributing was a strategic masterstroke. By partnering
with the best manufacturers globally, MSI could o er a
diverse range of high-quality products without the
burden of production delays and labor issues.
• Becoming a Logistics Company: Understanding the
critical role of logistics in business success, Manu
strategically positioned MSI as a logistics powerhouse.
This approach ensured e cient product movement,
from manufacturing sites to end consumers, enhancing
customer satisfaction and operational e ciency.
• Strategic Location of Physical Branches: Manu's
choice to establish MSI’s physical branches in major
coastal metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and
Newark, NJ, was another key strategic decision.
Proximity to major ports facilitated faster and more coste ective importation, giving MSI a competitive edge over
inland locations like Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and
Minneapolis.

and MSI's strategic growth. The focus on being an importerdistributor rather than a manufacturer re ects this cultural
inclination towards resource optimization and risk management.
2. The American Ideal of Innovation and Strategic Leadership:
The American business culture has always valued strategic
leadership and innovation as drivers of success. MSI's proactive
approach to strategic thinking, such as leveraging technological
advancements and optimizing supply chains, aligns with the
American belief in staying ahead through continuous innovation,
strategic planning, and adapting to changing market trends.

Harnessing the Attacker’s
Advantage
This chapter highlights how MSI's success is rooted in its strategic
use of the "attacker's advantage"—capitalizing on market
opportunities and disrupting competitors through innovation and
agility. Manu Shah, in uenced by his background in manufacturing
and chess, emphasized the importance of decisive action when
resources aligned. The chapter explores how MSI, under the
leadership of Manu and his sons Raj and Rup, leveraged technolo y,
strategic market positioning, and a forward-thinking company
culture to maintain a competitive edge and seize opportunities in a
fast-evolving industry.

Manu and MSI strategically followed the path of market
attackers, making signi cant progress while staying under
the radar—so much so that even their competitors didn’t
realize they were being outmaneuvered until it was too late.
They built strong partnerships with supply chains in
distant lands, leveraging resources like manpower,

Characterized by a relentless pursuit of opportunities,
MSI has thrived by exploiting the "attacker’s advantage"—a
strate y of capitalizing on innovation and market changes
to disrupt established players. This concept, which involves
capitalizing on changes and innovations to disrupt
established markets, has been a cornerstone of Raj and
Rup’s strate y and growth. By continuously challenging the
status quo and embracing innovative technologies and
market dynamics, MSI has transformed from a modest
enterprise into a leading player in the home surfacing
industry.

Recognizing the Attacker’s Advantage
Manu Shah’s early experiences in the manufacturing
sector exposed him to the inherent in exibility and
ine ciencies of large, established companies. These
organizations were often slow to adapt to market changes
and technological advancements, creating opportunities for
more agile and innovative players. Manu realized that by
staying nimble and being willing to take calculated risks,
MSI could outmaneuver larger competitors and capture
signi cant market share.

Leveraging Technological Innovations
One of the keyways MSI harnessed the attacker’s
advantage was through the early adoption of emerging
technologies. Manu recognized that technolo y could
revolutionize the traditionally low-tech industry of home
surfacing. By integrating o ce software such as Excel &

g

fl

ffi

fi

ffi

216

Word in the early 1980s, MSI improved Accuracy, Analytics
and E ciency, setting a new standard in the industry.
Later, MSI quickly responded to changing in the
marketplace; always ready to embrace digital tools and
platforms, such as augmented reality, Computer Vision and
arti cial intelligence, to enhance customer experiences and
streamline operations. These innovations allowed MSI to
o er unique services, like the Room Visualizer and Measure
My Room tools, which provided customers with
personalized and accurate project estimates. This
technological edge not only di erentiated MSI from
competitors but also reinforced its reputation as a forwardthinking company.

Strategic Market Entry and Expansion
Manu’s strategic decisions in market entry and expansion
also exemplify the attacker’s advantage. Recognizing the
shifting preferences of American homeowners, MSI moved
quickly to introduce natural stone products to the market.
By positioning MSI in key metropolitan areas with major
ports, such as Los Angeles and Newark, MSI ensured
e cient distribution and access to a broader customer
base. This strategic positioning allowed MSI to capture
signi cant market share and establish itself as a leader in
the natural stone industry.

Adapting to Economic and Geopolitical
Changes
MSI’s ability to adapt to economic and geopolitical
changes further highlights its use of the attacker’s
advantage. During the 2022 2023 shipping crisis, MSI
diversi ed its logistics with strategies and strengthened
relationships with shipping partners to manage costs and
ensure timely deliveries. Additionally, MSI’s initiative-taking
approach to sourcing from over thirty- ve countries
enabled it to navigate trade wars and tari s, maintaining
business continuity and competitiveness.

Fostering a Culture of Innovation
At the heart of MSI’s successful implementation of the
Attacker’s advantage, is a culture of innovation and
continuous improvement. Manu instilled a mindset that
encouraged employees to challenge conventional wisdom
and explore latest ideas. This culture of innovation ensured
that MSI remained agile and responsive to market trends,
allowing it to capitalize on opportunities that others might
overlook.

Conclusion: A Legacy of Strategic Agility
Manu and his two sons Raj & Rup’s strategic use of the
attacker’s advantage has been instrumental in MSI’s growth
and success. By staying ahead of the curve and
continuously adapting to changing market dynamics, MSI

established itself as a leader in the home surfacing industry.
This legacy of strategic agility and innovation continues to
dr ive MSI for ward, ensur ing its relevance and
competitiveness in an ever-evolving market.

Historical Context
1. The Rise of Technological Disruption (1980s-Present): The
period from the 1980s onwards has been marked by rapid
technological advancements, transforming industries and creating
opportunities for agile players to disrupt established markets. MSI's
early adoption of technologies like Excel, Word, augmented reality,
and AI mirrors how many successful companies leveraged
technological disruptions to gain a competitive edge and rede ne
industries.
2. Attacker’s Advantage in Business History: The concept of
the "attacker’s advantage" has been evident throughout business
history, where smaller, more agile companies disrupt larger,
established ones by being more innovative and responsive to market
changes. Companies like Amazon and Net ix exemplify this
strate y, disrupting traditional industries by embracing change and
leveraging technolo y—much like MSI’s journey in the home
surfacing industry.

background in chess and Indian cultural emphasis on strategic
thinking played a signi cant role in MSI's approach to the attacker's
advantage. In Indian culture, chess is seen as a game of strate y,
foresight, and calculated risks, qualities that Manu applied to his
business decisions, ensuring that MSI moved decisively when
opportunities arose.
2. American Entrepreneurial Spirit of Innovation and
Disruption: The American business landscape celebrates
disruptors who challenge the status quo and introduce innovative
solutions. MSI’s journey re ects this cultural ideal, where taking
bold steps, embracing technolo y, and challenging established
norms are valued traits of successful enterprises.
3. Embracing Change and Adaptability: The concept of
"jugaad," an Indian cultural idea that emphasizes creative problemsolving and adaptability, is re ected in MSI's approach to seizing the
attacker's advantage. This cultural mindset allowed MSI to remain
exible, adapt to changing circumstances, and innovate
continuously, driving its success in a dynamic industry.

Innovation – Turning
Visionary Thinking into
Breakthrough Growth
This chapter emphasizes how MSI has consistently embraced
innovation to drive growth and stay competitive in a fast-evolving
industry. Starting with Manu Shah’s forward-thinking approach to
global trends, MSI successfully leveraged technolo y and
international resources to build a strong foundation for future
expansion. The company’s success is rooted in creating a culture of
innovation, where open dialogue, psychological safety, and
diversity fuel continuous improvement. Whether through
technological advancements or navigating crises like COVID 19, MSI
has demonstrated that incremental progress and adaptability are
key to staying ahead.

id you know the little device in our pockets gives us
more communication power than President
Kennedy had? This shows that technolo y is giving us a
whole new world with ample opportunities. It took more
than 50 years before half of the U.S. population had a

phone. A century later, the rst wireless phone was
introduced, and it only took sixteen years before half of the
population owned one. A few years later came the
smartphone, which took less than six years for more than
half of the population to own one. This shows us that not
only is technolo y developing at an exponential pace, but
so is the adoption of this technolo y by the general
population.
This has enormous implications for our business. So, as
an organization, if we want to thrive in this dynamic and
fast- changing world, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY
INNOVATE.

As discussed previously, a prime example of visionary
thinking into tangible growth is the creation and success of
MSI's Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) operations. We
discussed how a modest team of 2 in 2005 in Bangalore
turned into a robust team of 600 by 2023. The BPO was a
direct result of Manu Shah's visionary adoption of global
trends highlighted by Thomas Friedman in 'The World is
Flat.'
It’s fascinating how MSI leveraged India’s educated
workforce and used technolo y to integrate them into MSI
USA’s daily operations. This exponential growth not only
optimized operational e ciencies across all departments
but also played a crucial role in enhancing MSI's
responsiveness to market demands and driving continuous
innovation, thereby solidifying MSI's competitive edge in
the fast-evolving surfacing industry.
Our aim is to adapt change and innovation slightly faster than
everyone else. – Manu Shah

How To Shape A Culture Of Innovation
• Build Clarity and Alignment around Innovation:
Aligning our team around a standard de nition of the
term ‘innovation’ is the rst step. Next, we must adopt a
common framework and language around the topic and
ensure everyone understands that innovation is not
simply ‘the act of coming up with new ideas but actually
implementing them after proper testing and validation.

fi

g

fi

ffi

223

• Create Psychological Safety: Looking honestly at
how we react to failure can be a very expressive factor
when innovation is the goal. If the culture of an
organization blames, shames, or punishes, the chances
that people will feel comfortable displaying behaviors
other than vertical compliance are slim to none. Hence a
culture of innovation expects a culture of openness and
freedom of thought.
• Encourage Dialogue: Honest and open dialogue can
only occur once people feel comfortable sharing their
true feelings. Reinforce the behaviors necessary to evolve
toward an innovation culture.
• Challenge Your Assumptions: It’s incredible how
many people operate daily, using an entire set of
unwritten or irrelevant “rules.” Of course, rules are in
place for a reason, but they shouldn’t be accepted blindly
without understanding the “why” behind those rules. A
practice is not necessarily correct just because it has
“always been done this way.” When the factors
contributing to the origin of the practice are no longer
relevant, the process itself should be subject to
improvement.
• Embrace Diversity: Bringing together a diverse
workforce can amplify our ability to innovate. Research
suggests that having diverse experiences, perspectives,
and backgrounds is crucial to innovation and developing
new ideas.
At MSI, we put innovation as a key strategic priority on
our agenda. Our mission lies in achieving sustainable
224

growth through business innovation, using thoughtful
strategies that allow us to bring new ideas to the business.
We keep an open mind and look for practical ways to move
at the speed of imagination.
As the maxim goes,
“the only constant is
c h a n g e .”
As
c o n t i n u o u s
incremental changes
continue to push the
boundaries of what’s
possible, we should
understand that
innovation can be
anywhere. At MSI, we
believe innovation
doesn’t need to ow
top-down or bottom-up; it is everyone’s responsibility.
COVID 19 has shown us how national and global events
can signi cantly a ect our thinking. Throughout the crisis,
distinctive innovation practices remained the same, but the
relative emphasis and urgency of where the business
should focus changed. The uncertainty and severity of the
situation demanded to rediscover needs and evolve our
business practices to meet those needs. As a result of
incremental innovation, MSI was able to not only survive
but thrive during the pandemic.

Conclusion
We understand that innovation at every step is possible
and necessary to keep progressing. However, it is only
through a culture of tolerance and open dialogue that
organizations can foster innovation, and leaders can
embrace the challenge to make a di erence.
If you’re building a skill, don’t stop. If you’re working on
a new idea, don’t stop. Every great achievement is on the
other side of constant progress.

Albert Einstein: "Imagination is more important than
knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination

Historical Context
1. The Technological Revolution (Late 20th to Early 21st
Century): The rapid development and adoption of technolo y,
particularly since the 1980s, has been a de ning factor in business
growth. MSI’s integration of advanced technologies, from early use
of digital tools to the adoption of augmented reality and AI, mirrors
how successful companies harnessed technological advancements to
drive innovation and stay ahead in an evolving market.

marked a signi cant shift in how businesses operated globally. MSI's
decision to leverage India's educated workforce for its BPO
operations re ects this broader trend of using global talent to
achieve operational e ciency and competitive advantage.
3. The COVID 19 Pandemic (2020 Present): The COVID 19
crisis forced businesses worldwide to rethink their operations and
adapt to rapidly changing conditions. MSI’s ability to thrive during
this period through incremental innovation demonstrates how
companies that are agile and willing to innovate can navigate
uncertainty and emerge stronger.
Cultural Context
1.
American Culture of Innovation and Adaptability: The
American business environment celebrates innovation,
adaptability, and the idea of pushing boundaries to achieve success.
MSI’s emphasis on fostering a culture of innovation, encouraging
open dialogue, and challenging assumptions aligns with this
cultural value of pursuing new ideas and staying ahead of the curve.
2. The Global Embrace of Diversity and Inclusion in
Innovation: In recent years, the understanding that diversity drives
innovation has gained signi cant traction. MSI’s commitment to

Fear of Failures
This chapter emphasizes Manu Shah's belief that failure is a
powerful teacher when paired with the right safety nets, which can
drive both learning and growth. Manu and Rika took calculated
risks when founding MSI, ensuring safeguards were in place to
mitigate potential losses. The chapter explores how they learned
from failures in partnerships and acquisitions, helping steer MSI
toward sustainable growth. It also highlights the introduction of
Phantom Stock Plans as a strategic move to align employees'
interests with the company's success by o ering cash payouts tied to
nancial metrics, without diluting company equity.

228

anu believes that failure is the best coach for
learning and evolving. From a young age,
children learn crucial lessons about trying, failing, and
improving. At 9 10 months old, a child observes others
standing and walking, tries to do the same, fails, improves,
and eventually stands up, bringing joy to their parents. This
process forms clusters of neurons in the brain, teaching the
child valuable lessons in resilience. Parents ensure a "safety
net" to prevent serious injury, a principle applicable to any
risk in life or business.

Lifelong Lessons
The lessons of trying, failing, and improving continue
throughout life in activities like walking, running, bicycling,
and swimming. However, many adults become fearful of
taking risks due to the fear of failure.

Manu and Rika's Risks
Manu and Rika took signi cant risks with a safety net in
place. During the auto industry layo s in late 1974, they
decided to always have a safety net. Although Manu was
not laid o , they founded MSI to supplement their income.
Manu continued his job at International Truck in Fort
Wayne, Indiana, as a safety net while MSI grew. When the
export of chips and microprocessors shifted to the Far East,
MSI was already importing granite blocks. Manu quit his job
as a Senior Project Engineer only after the Vietnam War
Memorial was completed in September 1982.

229

Facing Failures
Fear is the worst enemy of any journey. Despite
numerous failures, the journey and milestones continued
due to the safety net. Manu and Rika realized their mistake
in 1994 of making anyone a direct partner in MSI. Di erent
partners have di erent destinations and reasons for
joining, but MSI aims to be a legacy company for
generations, even at the cost of slow growth, with no
outside partners.

Business Acquisitions
During the 1990s, MSI acquired three smaller businesses
to expand its reach within the industry. They learned from
their mistakes and corrected them. Learning from their
sons, they ensured that any expansion of MSI was scalable,
measurable, and transparent. They moved out of the
installations business, which was not scalable, and projects
with architects, which took longer with uncertainty about
who would award the business.

Strategic Questions
Manu and Rika asked critical questions about their
interests, the line of business, the capabilities of their
salespeople, and the talent within the company. Since then,
MSI has focused on organic growth.

This chapter emphasizes the importance of learning from
failures, maintaining a safety net, and making strategic
decisions to ensure sustainable growth and success.
To solve feeing of ownership, MSI created Phantom Stock
– Ownership plan starting 2002.

Phantom Stock Plan: A Win-Win Solution for
Private Companies Like MSI
For private companies like MSI, o ering traditional stock
options to employees may not always be the most viable or
e ective incentive. In contrast, Phantom Stock Plans
provide a highly exible, valuable, and risk-free option for
rewarding key leaders, supervisors, and high-performing
employees. Phantom stock is essentially a form of deferred
compensation where employees receive cash bonuses that
mimic the bene ts of stock ownership—without the
complexities of issuing actual shares or diluting equity.

What Is a Phantom Stock Plan?
A Phantom Stock Plan grants employees "phantom" or
virtual shares, which are tied to the nancial performance
of the company. The employees don’t own actual stock, but
their rewards are linked to the value of the company, just as
if they were real shareholders. At MSI, the value of
phantom stock can be tied to key nancial metrics, such as
revenue growth and gross pro t margin. Employees are
rewarded based on the company's performance over time.

fi

fi

ff

fi

fi

fl

ff

231

Employees in the phantom stock plan receive a payout
equivalent to the value of the virtual shares, typically after
a vesting period. MSI’s plan, for example, has a three-year
vesting period, after which employees receive guaranteed
cash payouts each year based on the growth and
pro tability of the company.

Advantages of Phantom Stock Plans
Phantom stock plans o er a range of bene ts for both
employees and the company, making them a perfect t for
a private company like MSI:
Alignment with Company Success: Since the value of
phantom stock is tied directly to MSI's revenue growth and
pro t margins, employees are motivated to contribute to
the company’s overall success. The better MSI performs,
the higher the payout for employees.
Guaranteed Cash Out: One of the key bene ts of MSI’s
Phantom Stock Plan is that it o ers a guaranteed cash-out
option after the initial three-year period. Employees don’t
need to worry about market volatility or waiting for an IPO
or acquisition to realize value from their shares. This
certainty provides a clear and motivating nancial
incentive.
No Equity Dilution: As a private company, MSI is able to
keep full control of its ownership structure. Since phantom
stock is not actual equity, there’s no need to issue new
shares, preventing the dilution of ownership for existing
shareholders.

fi

fi

fi

fi

ff

ff

fi

fi

232

Retention Tool: The three-year vesting period serves as
an excellent employee retention tool, especially for leaders
and supervisors. By o ering a deferred payout, employees
have an incentive to stay with the company longer to fully
realize the bene ts of the plan.
F l ex i b i l i t y: P h a n t o m s t o c k p l a n s a re h i g h ly
customizable. MSI can adjust the terms based on the
company's performance metrics, such as tying payouts to
revenue growth or gross pro t margin, or even providing
additional rewards based on individual performance.

A Focus on Long-Term Growth
By implementing a Phantom Stock Plan tied to metrics
like revenue growth and gross pro t margin, MSI creates an
ecosystem where employees are rewarded for their
contributions to the long-term growth and pro tability of
the company. This structure ensures that leaders and
supervisors remain focused on driving sustainable success
and are incentivized to perform their best year after year.
Phantom stock plans, with their guaranteed payouts and
alignment with company performance, o er an ideal
solution for private companies like MSI to incentivize and
reward top talent without the challenges of traditional
stock options or equity dilution. They help build a culture
of long-term commitment, shared success, and nancial
security for the company and its employees.

This chapter highlights Manu Shah's realization that while longterm predictions are useful, adaptability is key to navigating the
unpredictable short and medium term. His expertise in statistics
shaped this understanding, which became fundamental to MSI’s
growth. By swiftly adapting to technological changes, economic

anu was a star student in statistics during his
undergrad at VJTI and in his Master’s Purdue
University. His excitement for predicting various factors—
from economic growth to the structural life of auto
components—was evident early on. He applied his
statistical skills to forecast a multitude of scenarios, only to
realize that predictability was often unreliable, especially in
the short and medium term. This realization came from a
deeper understanding that even with vast knowledge,
much more remains unknown.
While Manu's statistical predictions were valuable in the
long term, they hinged on the accuracy of numerous
assumptions. He soon discovered that important
assumptions frequently remained unidenti ed, making
short and medium-term predictions inaccurate. This
understanding was pivotal for Manu, who concluded that
adaptability was far more crucial than predictability.

Adaptability
In our fast-paced, constantly evolving world, adaptability
isn't just a nice-to-have skill – it's essential for success.
Whether it's navigating unexpected workplace changes,
adjusting to new technologies, or simply coping with life's
curveballs, being adaptable empowers us to overcome
challenges and seize opportunities.
Adaptability is the ability to adjust to new conditions or
situations. It's about being exible in our thinking and
actions, embracing change instead of resisting it. Adaptable
individuals are open-minded, resourceful, and quick

challenges as chances to grow and develop.

Building of Adaptability muscle in early years
Manu’s life exempli ed adaptability. Growing up in a
small town and moving to the bustling city of Mumbai, he
transitioned seamlessly from being a local student to an
honors engineer at Purdue University. He found a choice
job during the turbulent years of 1967 69, re ecting his
ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
The following realization led Manu to a eureka moment:
the key to success lies in adaptability. He applied this
philosophy to MSI, working hard to make every part of the
company adaptable. Whether it was responding to
economic changes, interest rates, housing starts,
remodeling spending, unemployment rates, geopolitical
risks, the COVID 19 crisis, or the shipping crisis, MSI's
adaptability became its core strength.

Adaptability in Technolo y
The Shah family ensured MSI stayed ahead by quickly
adapting to technological advancements. From PCs, fax
machines, and distributed processing to digital cameras,
the internet, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and AI starting
in 2016, MSI's adaptability kept it competitive in a rapidly
changing world.

labor in India Subcontinent (strict guidelines &
certi cations from all suppliers plus random check from
outside services. Also avoiding goofy arrangements by
some suppliers using di erent addresses or names. By
assessing these risks continuously, MSI ensures compliance

with international laws and maintains its corporate
responsibility.

Compliance and Safety Standards
Adhering to Regulations
Compliance with government regulations and consumer
safety standards is paramount at MSI. The company
rigorously adheres to all applicable laws to mitigate
compliance risks. This not only protects the company from
legal repercussions but also builds trust with consumers
and partners by ensuring product safety and integrity.

Business Continuity Planning
Adapting to Market and Geopolitical Changes
MSI maintains a dynamic approach to business
continuity by having suppliers in over 35 countries, which
allows the company to pivot quickly in response to
geopolitical events, such as the con ict in Ukraine.
Continuously updating product o erings to match changing
trends in the housing industry, such as shifts in color, size,
and design preferences, is also crucial. This exibility
ensures MSI can meet market demands and avoid
disruptions.

Ensuring Long-Term Viability
The rapid rise in interest rates in 2022 2023, which
signi cantly impacted the housing market and home
a ordability, highlighted the importance of monitoring the
nancial health of both MSI and its suppliers. Ensuring
suppliers are nancially stable allows for long-term
planning and reduces the risk of sudden disruptions in the
supply chain.

also reinforces its commitment to excellence and reliability.
This chapter illustrates how embracing a holistic approach
to risk management is essential for navigating the
complexities of global trade and maintaining a resilient
business model.

Ensuring Customer Satisfaction Through
Strategic Inventory Management
In the complex web of global supply and demand, the
end consumers' needs remain paramount at MSI. A critical
aspect of MSI's risk management strate y is to shield
customers from the disruptions inherent in international
trade and supply chain uctuations. Manu Shah and his
team understand that customers are generally indi erent to
the origins of the products—they care primarily about
availability and price at the point of need.

Proactive Customer Communication
MSI prioritizes transparent communication with
customers regarding supply chain issues that may a ect
product availability. By keeping customers informed, MSI
helps manage expectations and builds trust, even in
uncertain times. This proactive communication is crucial in
maintaining customer relationships, as it provides
customers with the information they need to make
informed decisions.

Building Resilient Inventory Systems
To further protect against potential disruptions, MSI has
implemented strategic inventory management practices.
Recognizing the importance of product availability, MSI
maintains robust inventory levels, especially for products
that are at higher risk of supply chain disruption due to
geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or other unforeseen
events.

Bu er Stocks for High-Demand Products
MSI strategically builds bu er stocks for high-demand
products to ensure that supply chain disruptions do not
translate into shortages for consumers. This approach
involves predictive analysis to identify which products are
most likely to be a ected by external factors and adjusting
inventory levels accordingly. By doing so, MSI can smooth
out the uctuations in supply, ensuring that products are
available when customers need them, without signi cant
delays or price increases.

Minimizing Price Impact
An integral part of MSI’s strate y is to absorb some of the
cost uctuations caused by supply chain disruptions to
minimize the impact on the consumer price. While it's not
always possible to completely avoid passing on costs to
customers, MSI strives to mitigate these as much as possible
to maintain a ordability and prevent customer churn.

risky given the prevailing market conditions. However, this
calculated risk paid o , allowing us to tap into new markets
and further solidify our presence in the industry. This
expansion demonstrated our commitment to growth and
our ability to make bold decisions in the face of
uncertainty.

Adapting to COVID 19: Swift Transition to
Remote Work
Before the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, remote work
was a privilege enjoyed by only a few at MSI. However, as
the pandemic spread and lockdowns were enforced, the
need for a swift transition to remote work became
imperative. In less than a week, our dedicated team
managed to procure the necessary hardware and tools to
enable the entire workforce to work from home. This quick
and e cient response was a critical risk mitigation measure
that ensured zero downtime during one of the most
challenging periods in recent history. Our ability to adapt
quickly not only kept operations running smoothly but also
safeguarded the health and well-being of our employees.
MSI's journey through these challenges underscores the
importance of strategic risk management and the value of

powerful example of resilience and the impact of proactive
risk management.

inventory practices, MSI not only ensures its own
operational e ciency but also upholds its commitment to
customer satisfaction. By anticipating potential disruptions
and maintaining open lines of communication, MSI aligns

The Dynamics of Family in
Business
This chapter emphasizes how Manu Shah’s success with MSI is
deeply intertwined with family support, highlighting the integration
of family and business responsibilities. Manu, along with his wife
Rika and sons Raj and Rup, collectively contributed to the
company’s growth, seeing family and business as inseparable. While
managing a family-run business presents challenges, such as
maintaining professional boundaries, the loyalty and shared vision
among family members drove MSI’s success. Drawing parallels with
companies like Walmart and Ford, the chapter showcases how
family involvement and unity are key to long-term entrepreneurial

or Manu Shah, the support of his family has been a
cornerstone of his entrepreneurial journey. "Without
my family's unwavering support, I couldn't have achieved
what I did with MSI," he says. From the early days of MSI,
his family's involvement and encouragement played a
critical role in the company's success.
This dynamic is evident in Manu's story, where his
family's collective e orts helped build MSI from the ground
up.

Balancing Family and Business
Responsibilities
Balancing family and business responsibilities is a
challenge that many entrepreneurs face. Manu's approach
to this balance has been one of integration rather than
separation. "I never saw family and business as two
separate entities," he explains. "They are intertwined, and
each supports the other."
This approach allowed Manu to involve his family in the
business, creating a sense of shared purpose and mutual
support. "When you work together towards a common
goal, it strengthens both the family bond and the business,"
he notes. This philosophy has been instrumental in
maintaining harmony and achieving success in both areas.

Involvement of Family Members in MSI
The involvement of family members in MSI has been a
de ning feature of the company's growth. Manu's wife,
Rika, played a crucial role in the early years, managing
administrative tasks and helping with strategic decisions.

managed the household while also being deeply involved in
the business."
Manu's sons, Raj and Rup, have also been integral to
MSI's success. They joined the business, bringing fresh
perspectives and driving innovation. "Raj and Rup have
taken MSI to new heights," Manu proudly states. "Their
vision and dedication have been key to our continued
growth."
Manu believes that having family members involved in
the business has fostered a strong sense of loyalty and
commitment. "Family members are deeply invested in the
success of the business," he explains. "This shared
commitment drives the company forward."

Challenges and Bene ts of a Family-Run
Business
Running a family business comes with its unique set of
challenges and bene ts. One of the primary challenges is
maintaining professional boundaries while nurturing
personal relationships. "It's important to di erentiate

ff

between family roles and business roles," Manu advises.
"Clear communication and mutual respect are essential."
However, the bene ts often outweigh the challenges. A
family-run business fosters a strong sense of loyalty and
commitment. "Family members are deeply invested in the
success of the business," Manu explains. "This shared
commitment drives the company forward."
This mindset resonates with Manu's approach to
integrating family and business. Despite the challenges, he
pursued what he believed was important, creating a legacy
that combines both personal and professional success.

Personal Anecdotes and Experiences
Manu recalls a time when the entire family worked
together to ful ll a critical order. "We were all hands on
deck, from the youngest to the oldest," he laughs. "It was a
true team e ort, and it brought us closer together."
Another memorable experience was the decision to
expand MSI's operations. "We held a family meeting to
discuss the risks and opportunities," Manu shares. "It was a
collaborative decision, and it reinforced our collective
vision for the future."

Staying Private: Choices and
Implications
This chapter explores MSI's strategic decision to remain a private
company, a move that has allowed the Shah family—Manu, Raj, and
Rup—to maintain control over the company's values and long-term
goals. By avoiding the pressures of public markets, MSI has been
able to focus on sustainable growth, reinvesting pro ts into the
business and preserving a strong corporate culture. While staying
private presents challenges like limited access to capital and
reduced visibility, MSI has overcome these through customer
loyalty, nancial discipline, and solid internal processes, ensuring
its stability even during economic downturns.

hah Family’s(Manu, Raj,
Rup) decision to keep
MSI private was driven by a
clear vision and strategic
considerations. "We wanted to
maintain control over our
company's direc tion and
values," Manu explains. For
MSI, remaining private meant
that the company could
prioritize long-term growth over short-term gains, a luxury
not always a orded to public companies. The decision to
stay private allowed MSI to remain nimble and responsive
to market changes without the pressure of quarterly
earnings reports and shareholder expectations. "We could
make decisions that were best for the company in the long
run, without being in uenced by the market's short-term
demands," Manu notes.

Bene ts of Remaining a Private Company
One of the primary bene ts of staying private is the
ability to maintain control over the company's operations
and strategic direction. For MSI, this meant that Manu and
his family could implement their vision without external
interference. "We didn't have to answer to outside investors
or deal with the volatility of the stock market," Manu says.
Remaining private also allowed MSI to cultivate a unique
corporate culture. "Our employees are like family to us,"
Manu explains. "We can focus on their well-being and invest
in their growth without the pressure of meeting external

fi

Moreover, staying private has enabled MSI to reinvest
pro ts back into the business. "We have the exibility to
allocate resources where they are needed most," Manu
states. This includes investing in new technologies,
expanding operations, and entering new markets. The
ability to make these strategic investments has been a key
driver of MSI's growth and success.

Challenges Faced by Private Companies
While there are signi cant bene ts to staying private, it
also comes with its own set of challenges. One of the
primary challenges is access to capital. "Without the ability
to issue public stock, we had to rely on internal resources
and private funding," Manu explains. This required careful
nancial planning and a disciplined approach to managing
cash ow. Another challenge is the lack of public visibility.
"As a private company, we don't have the same level of
exposure as public companies," Manu notes. This can make
it more di cult to attract top talent and establish brand
recognition. However, MSI has successfully navigated this
challenge by building a strong reputation in the industry
and fostering a loyal customer base.
Manu also points out that staying private requires a
strong commitment to transparency and governance. "We
have to ensure that our internal processes and controls are
robust," he says. This includes maintaining accurate
nancial records, conducting regular audits, and
implementing e ective risk management practices.

expectations." This approach has fostered a strong sense of
loyalty and commitment among MSI's workforce.

Another memorable experience was the decision to
expand MSI's operations into new markets. "We had the
exibility to take calculated risks and pursue opportunities
that aligned with our long-term vision," Manu explains. This
included entering the natural stone market, which has
become a signi cant growth area for MSI.

Other Successful Private Companies
The concept of remaining private is not unique to MSI.
Historically, some of the world's most successful companies
have chosen to stay private. Examples include Cargill, Koch
Industries, and Mars, Inc., each of which has thrived by
maintaining control over their operations and strategic
direction. Cargill, one of the largest privately held
companies in the world, has leveraged its private status to
make long-term investments in agriculture and food
production. Koch Industries, known for its diversi ed
operations, has also bene ted from the exibility and
stability provided by remaining private. Mars, Inc., a global
leader in confectionery, pet care, and food products, has
maintained its private status to preserve its family-oriented
culture and values.
These examples highlight the potential bene ts of staying
private and demonstrate that private companies can
achieve signi cant success and growth. Manu's story with
MSI adds to this legacy, showcasing how a private company

achieve long-term success.

Manu's Re ections on MSI's Decision to Stay
Private
Re ecting on MSI's journey, Manu emphasizes the
importance of staying true to the company's core values
and vision. "Staying private has allowed us to prioritize
customer satisfaction, investing in employee development,
and pursuing sustainable growth." He adds, "We have the
freedom to make decisions that align with our long-term
goals." He also notes that staying private has fostered a
sense of stability and continuity within the company. "Our
employees know that we are committed to their well-being
and the long-term success of the business," Manu states.
This has created a loyal and motivated workforce that is
dedicated to MSI's mission and values.
Manu's re ections on the decision to stay private are
echoed by other successful entrepreneurs. Michael Dell,
founder of Dell Technologies, once said, "The beauty of
being private is that you don't have to answer to anyone
except your customers." This sentiment resonates with
Manu's approach, highlighting the advantages of
maintaining control and focusing on long-term success.

MSI's Financial Stability and Growth
MSI's decision to remain private has also contributed to
its nancial stability. By avoiding the pressures of public
markets, MSI has been able to manage its nances

fi

conservatively. This approach has allowed the company to
weather economic downturns and continue growing
steadily. "We've always prioritized long-term stability over
short-term gains," Manu explains. This philosophy has been
key to MSI's resilience and success. For example, during
economic recessions, many companies face nancial strain
and are forced to make drastic cuts. However, MSI's
conservative nancial management has allowed it to
maintain operations and even grow during these
c h a l l e n g i n g t i m e s . " D u r i n g re c e s s i o n s , we s aw
opportunities to gain market share from competitors who
are struggling," Manu says. This strategic mindset has
enabled MSI to emerge stronger from economic downturns.

Concluding remarks
Manu's decision to keep MSI private has been a strategic
choice that has enabled the company to thrive. By
maintaining control over the company's direction and
values, Manu has created a business that is responsive to
market changes and committed to long-term growth. His
story serves as an inspiration to other entrepreneurs,
showcasing the bene ts of staying private and the
importance of staying true to one's vision and values.

Leadership - Hungry for
Problem Solving
Leadership is not just about vision; it is about solving problems
before they escalate into crises. Great leaders anticipate challenges
and act swiftly, understanding that postponing issues only makes
them worse. Throughout history, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's New
Deal during the Great Depression to Nelson Mandela's reconciliation
e orts in post-apartheid South Africa, e ective leaders have tackled
problems head-on. In the business world, Steve Jobs at Apple
streamlined product lines and reignited innovation by addressing
unsold inventory and ine ciencies. At MSI, challenges like senior
leadership issues, unsold inventory, or operational ine ciencies
can’t be left to linger. Managing by crisis is unsustainable; instead,
leaders must identify and resolve one major problem each week,
along with a few smaller ones, to stay ahead. As Peter Drucker
noted, the danger lies not in wrong answers, but in asking the wrong
questions—leaders must confront the tough issues to guide their
teams to success. Ultimately, leadership is about problem-solving;
without problems to solve, leadership becomes irrelevant.

ffi

ff

ffi

ff

276

eadership isn’t just about having a vision; it’s about
taking action when things go wrong. All too often,
unresolved problems—whether large or small— can fester
and grow, creating crises that should never have existed in
the rst place. A good leader recognizes that postponing an
issue doesn't make it disappear. In fact, it makes it worse.
As the ancient Chinese proverb says, "The best time to
plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now."
This same principle applies to leadership—solving problems
at the earliest opportunity ensures future stability and
growth.
Throughout history, great leaders have distinguished
themselves by their ability to confront and resolve
problems. Consider Abraham Lincoln during the American
Civil War. Faced with the monumental challenge of keeping
the Union together, Lincoln made the di cult decision to
issue the Emancipation Proclamation, a move that not only
addressed the issue of slavery but also strengthened the
Union’s moral cause. In doing so, he confronted a lingering
problem that had divided the country for decades, securing
both a military and moral victory.
In the world of technolo y, Steve Jobs’ leadership at
Apple provides another compelling example. Upon his
return to the company in 1997, he faced a bloated product
line and unsold inventory clogging up Apple’s supply chain.
Rather than allowing these issues to drag the company
down, Jobs made swift decisions to streamline the product
lineup, cutting away excess and focusing on innovation. His
problem-solving approach was a key factor in Apple’s
resurgence as one of the world’s most valuable companies.

ffi

g

fi

277

At MSI, There are similar patterns. Sometimes, a senior
leader needs to be demoted or let go for the good of the
organization. Unsold inventory takes up valuable space in
our warehouses, and habitual tardiness from otherwise
good associates can set a bad example for others. Other
times, it’s operational costs spiraling out of control, a
salesperson’s refusal to promote new products, or ongoing
space and tra c issues that cause headaches at Warehouse
& su er Customer Experience. Whatever the problem, it’s
the leader’s job to identify it, confront it, and solve it.
Managing by crisis is not sustainable. Crisis management
often results from letting problems linger too long, waiting
until they erupt into something far bigger than they need to
be. As leaders, we must avoid falling into this trap. The
solution? Each week, identify at least one major problem
that has been lingering for too long. In addition, pick a few
smaller issues and resolve them. This consistent approach
ensures that we stay ahead of potential crises and maintain
a proactive, rather than reactive, mindset.

Modern Leadership: Act or Manage by Crisis?
In today’s fast-paced world, leaders face a myriad of
challenges—from operational ine ciencies to sta ng
issues, from unsold inventory clogging up valuable
warehouse space to managing associates with chronic
lateness. These are the kinds of problems that don’t
disappear with time but instead compound until they
demand urgent attention. Some leaders manage by crisis,
waiting until the situation is dire before acting. But the best

ffi

ffi

ffi

ff

278

leaders know that the key is to regularly address problems
before they balloon into larger issues.
Whether it’s controlling operational costs, dealing with a
senior leader whose performance has slipped, or
addressing logistical issues like space and tra c, leaders
must make decisions. A proactive leader should aim to
solve at least one major lingering problem each week and a
few smaller ones. This steady approach ensures smooth
operations and reinforces the message that leadership is
about action, not avoidance.
As Peter Drucker, the father of modern management,
once said, "The most serious mistakes are not being made
as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is
asking the wrong questions." In other words, it is the
leader’s responsibility to ask the tough questions and then
take action to resolve the answers—no matter how
uncomfortable they may be.
Ultimately, all leaders must understand their main job: to
lead through solving problems. Without problems to solve,
a leader’s role becomes irrelevant. It is through addressing
these challenges, week after week, that leaders truly
demonstrate their worth and set their organizations on a
path to success. So, the next time a problem arises, don’t
wait for it to become a crisis. Solve it, and lead your team to
a better, more secure future.

ffi

279

The Role of Problem Solving in Leadership
At its core, leadership is
problem-solving. If there
are no problems, why do
we need a leader?
Leadership is about more
than holding a title—it’s
about creating solutions,
ensuring the organization
remains agile, and driving
continuous improvement.
The strength of leadership
is not in avoiding
challenges but in facing them directly and consistently.
In conclusion, whether rooted in history, technolo y, or
cultural wisdom, the lesson remains the same: great
leaders solve problems. They act with foresight, courage,
and integrity, knowing that their primary role is to guide
their team or organization through the challenges of today
while preparing for tomorrow’s opportunities. So, when a
problem arises, take that rst step—lead, and solve.

Henry Ford: "Don't nd fault, nd a remedy; anybody can
complain."
Abraham Lincoln: "The best way to predict your future is
to create it."

Warren Bennis : "The most dangerous leadership myth is
that leaders are born—that there is a genetic factor to
leadership. This myth asserts that people simply either
have certain charismatic qualities or not. That’s nonsense;
in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than
born."
John C. Maxwell: "A leader is one who knows the way,
goes the way, and shows the way."
Warren Bennis: "Leadership is the capacity to translate
vision into reality."
Historical Context: Leadership Through Crisis
In history, some of the most revered leaders were those who faced
problems head-on rather than allowing them to fester. One vivid
example is Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. When
FDR assumed the presidency in 1933, the U.S. was reeling from a
crippling economic downturn. Rather than delaying, he took
immediate action, launching the New Deal, a series of programs
and reforms that directly addressed unemployment, nancial
instability, and social welfare. His proactive stance is a prime
example of leadership not waiting for problems to turn into fullblown crises, but instead tackling them early with decisive action.
In the same vein, Nelson Mandela’s approach to leadership
during South Africa's transition from apartheid is equally
instructive. Mandela faced decades of racial division, political strife,
and the deep-rooted problems of inequality. Rather than managing
by crisis, he proactively worked to heal a fractured nation through
reconciliation, even when others advocated for retribution. By
addressing the core issue—division—Mandela built a lasting legacy of
unity and peace.
Technological Context: Leading with Innovation

fi

281

In the technolo y world, leaders like Je Bezos exemplify how
problem-solving can steer companies toward success. In the early
days of Amazon, unsold inventory and ine ciencies in the supply
chain were critical problems. Bezos didn’t let these problems
stagnate. Instead, he embraced innovative solutions like the
creation of automated warehouses and the integration of advanced
logistics systems. By addressing these challenges head-on, Amazon
became a logistical powerhouse, setting new standards in ecommerce and delivery. This is a prime example of how
technological leadership involves not just reacting to problems but
anticipating and solving them before they become crises.
Cultural Context: Problem Solving as an Ethical Responsibility
Culturally, di erent societies o er diverse perspectives on
leadership and problem-solving. In Japanese culture, for instance,
the concept of Kaizen, or continuous improvement, has long been a
guiding principle in business and management. This philosophy
suggests that incremental problem-solving daily—however small—
leads to long-term organizational health. Toyota’s famous Just-inTime manufacturing system exempli es this approach. By
continuously addressing production problems and ine ciencies as
they arose, Toyota revolutionized global manufacturing practices,
showcasing how consistent, proactive problem-solving leads to
technological and organizational breakthroughs.
Another cultural perspective can be found in ancient Indian
philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of duty (Dharma).
Leaders, according to the Bhagavad Gita, must ful ll their
responsibilities without attachment to personal gain. This cultural
wisdom reinforces that leaders are ethically bound to act, especially
when they see issues or challenges in their path. Leadership in this
sense is about doing what is right—solving problems when they arise
and not postponing the inevitable.

A New Vision: Granite in American Kitchens
Amidst these successes, Manu harbored a vision to
transform the American kitchen. He saw potential for the
use of shiny, premium black granite as a staple in kitchen
design, a shift from its traditional applications in outdoor
and public architecture. Kitchens were increasingly
becoming the heart of the home—a place for family
gatherings and everyday activities. Until then, kitchen
countertops typically featured ceramic tiles or Formica,
which were susceptible to damage from heat and everyday
kitchen substances like wine or lemon juice.

The Los Angeles Move: Reaching the Architects
and Designers
To realize this vision, MSI moved closer to the largest
containerized port in the USA in the Los Angeles area,
positioning itself strategically to import vast quantities of
granite. From 1983 to 1986, Manu traveled coast-to-coast,
meeting with architects and designers to promote the use
of granite in kitchens. Two years of struggle in1984 1986 to
make Black Granite as part of the Kitchen & Despite
countless initial reluctance, the breakthrough came when a
couple from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California,
decided to install a kitchen countertop made from
premium black granite imported from India.

The Trend Catches On
This rst installation led to a ripple e ect. Within three
months, three more neighbors on Rodeo Drive chose MSI’s

shiny black granite countertops for their kitchens. News of
this luxurious and practical choice traveled fast, eventually
reaching Manhattan, New York. Granite countertops soon
became a requisite feature in upscale homes, sparking a
nationwide trend that transformed kitchen aesthetics.

The Expansion of Granite Varieties
As the demand for granite kitchen countertops grew, MSI
began importing a diverse array of granite colors and
designs from Brazil, Norway, Italy, and eventually China.
This expansion not only catered to varying consumer
preferences but also solidi ed MSI’s leadership in the
granite market.

MSI: A Leader in Granite Distribution
Through strategic foresight, relentless pursuit of
innovation, and a deep understanding of market trends,
MSI grew to become a top player in supplying granite slabs
to fabricators across the country. What started with a single
public memorial blossomed into a nationwide trend that
rede ned interior design in American homes, proving that
even the most traditional materials could nd new life in
modern applications.
This chapter of MSI’s story highlights Manu's leadership
and the company's talent for adapting to and anticipating
market trends. Their in uence can be seen in public
memorials and private spaces across America.

mirrored the cultural focus on luxury and exclusivity, setting trends
that spread nationwide. MSI’s role in introducing granite into
kitchens capitalized on this trend, transforming the market.
Cultural Context:
1. Rebranding Granite for Home Use: Traditionally seen as
a somber material used for memorials, granite underwent a
cultural transformation in the 1980s as MSI successfully marketed it
for home interiors. This shift from public to private space re ects
changing consumer attitudes, where materials once associated with
solemnity were now seen as luxurious and practical for everyday
living.
2. In uence of Hollywood and Design Trends: The decision
to use granite in Beverly Hills homes sparked a design trend that
quickly spread across the U.S. Hollywood’s in uence on fashion,
design, and lifestyle meant that decisions made by celebrities and
a uent individuals had a signi cant impact on mainstream
consumer choices. MSI’s strategic focus on promoting granite in
such high-pro le locations demonstrates the cultural power of elite
markets in shaping broader consumer preferences.

over
Management: Manu Shah’s
Philosophy at MSI

innovation, open communication, and collective responsibility,
shaped by his experiences in the Midwest. By viewing employees as
the company’s greatest asset, Manu has led MSI to success through
adaptable leadership that encourages autonomy and team
development. This approach has helped MSI remain competitive
and innovative in a rapidly evolving business environment.

298

rom the inception of
MSI, Manu Shah has
been clear about his
preference for leadership
over
traditional
management. He believes
that true progress and a
positive work environment
stem from inspirational
leadership rather than
authoritative management.
This chapter delves into Manu's leadership philosophy, how
it has shaped the company's culture, provided fertile bed
for Innovations and why this approach is more pertinent
than ever in today’s rapidly changing business landscape.
Status-Quo is never accepted at MSI.

Leadership vs. Management at MSI
Manu Shah’s disdain for the term "manager" is rooted in a
fundamental belief in the power of leadership to evoke
change, inspire action, and foster an environment of
mutual respect and innovation. At MSI, terms like
"Director," "Team Leader," and "Senior Leader" are
preferred over "Manager" to emphasize the role of leading
rather than ruling.
• Inviting Conversation vs. Demanding Obedience:
Manu champions a culture where leaders invite
conversation and encourage open communication. He
believes that leadership involves listening to and
collaborating with the team rather than commanding
299

• Credit Giving vs. Blame Assigning: At MSI, leaders
are encouraged to give credit to their teams and shoulder
responsibility for setbacks. This approach not only boosts
team morale but also fosters a sense of collective
responsibility and achievement.
• Listening vs. Talking: True leadership, according to
Manu, is about listening to the needs, ideas, and
feedback of the team. This fosters a collaborative
environment where all voices are heard and valued.
• Empowerment vs. Discipline: Manu’s leadership
model focuses on empowering employees rather than
disciplining them. He believes in nurturing an
entrepreneurial spirit within the team, transforming
employees into proactive contributors and brand
advocates.

Early Experiences Shaping Leadership
Philosophy
During his rst 17 years in the Midwest, Manu witnessed
rsthand the impact of economic cycles on the workforce.
Layo s were common in the auto and manufacturing sectors,
leading to widespread insecurity among workers. Manu
recognized that while companies often survived these cycles,
the human cost was signi cant. This experience shaped his
leadership philosophy at MSI, where he made a rm
commitment to never lay o employees due to a lack of work.
His approach was rooted in the belief that employees are the

greatest asset a company has—an asset that doesn't show up
on any balance sheet. Manu's mantra for his employees, "Your
pain is our pain, your gain is our gain," became a guiding
principle at MSI, fostering a culture of loyalty and mutual
respect.

The Importance of Leadership in Modern
Business
The rate of change in today’s business environment is
unprecedented. Manu understands that navigating this
constant change requires leaders who can swiftly adapt and
guide their teams through transitions without waiting for
directives from above. This philosophy is increasingly
relevant as businesses face rapid technolo gic al
advancements and shifting market dynamics.
• Adaptability and Autonomy: Leaders at MSI are
equipped to make decisions that align with the
company’s core values and long-term vision without
constant oversight. This autonomy allows for quicker
adaptations to changing conditions.
• Focus on Team Development: MSI’s leaders are also
coaches who develop their team members' skills and
capacities. This focus ensures that the workforce remains
competitive and aligned with industry advancements.
Additionally, MSI has enjoyed devotion and loyalty from
its employees with hardly any leaders, seniors or long
term employees leaving the company, except for weaker
players who were in the wrong bus.

301

• Engagement and Innovation: By fostering a team
atmosphere where creative ideas are welcomed and
innovation is routine, MSI maintains its leading edge in
the competitive marketplace.

References and Thought Leadership
Manu’s approach aligns with insights from thought
leaders and business experts who have underscored the
di erences between managers and leaders. For instance,
leadership experts such as John Maxwell and Simon Sinek
emphasize the importance of leaders who can inspire trust,
foster creativity, and lead by example. These principles are
embedded in MSI’s leadership practices and have been key
to its success.

Conclusion: Cultivating a Legacy of Leadership
Manu Shah’s preference for leadership over management
is not just a personal philosophy but a strategic approach
that has deeply in uenced MSI’s corporate culture and
operational success. By prioritizing leadership qualities in
all its senior roles, MSI has cultivated an environment
where innovation thrives, teams feel empowered, and
leaders are prepared to face the challenges of the future.

Envisioning the Big Picture
This chapter emphasizes Manu Shah's success with MSI,
showcasing how his strategic vision and adaptability transformed
the company into a global industry leader. His ambition to make
natural stone a staple in every home, combined with his ability to
harness market trends and technolo y, propelled MSI's growth.
Manu’s leadership, centered on a people- rst approach and mastery
of the global supply chain, has enabled the company to navigate
challenges and maintain steady growth. His journey serves as a
blueprint for entrepreneurship, illustrating how foresight,
innovation, and a strong organizational culture drive long-term
success.

fi

g

306

n the ever-evolving landscape of entrepreneurship, the
ability to perceive and act upon the "Big Picture" is not
just advantageous—it is essential for enduring success.
Manu exempli es this principle throughout his remarkable
journey. His story is one of foresight, adaptability, and
strategic brilliance, woven together to create a global
enterprise that has left an indelible mark on the natural
stone industry.

A Clear Mission Lighting the Path
From the very inception of MSI in 1975, Manu understood
the profound importance of a clear and compelling
mission. He articulated the ambitious goal of placing
"Natural Stone in Every Home," a vision that was both
inspiring and directional. This mission served as the
company's North Star, guiding every decision, investment,
and strate y undertaken over the decades.

fi

g

307

At a time when natural stone was considered a luxury
reserved for the a uent, Manu saw untapped potential in
making these exquisite materials accessible to a broader
market. He believed that natural stone could transform
everyday living spaces, adding beauty and value to homes
across America and beyond. This conviction drove MSI to
innovate in product sourcing, pricing, and distribution,
e ectively democratizing access to high-quality natural
stone products.

Reading and Shaping Market Dynamics
Manu's acute understanding of market dynamics was
instrumental in propelling MSI to industry leadership. In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, as consumer preferences
began shifting from traditional carpeting to more durable
and aesthetically pleasing hard surfaces, Manu anticipated
the burgeoning demand for natural stone and engineered
surfaces.
Rather than simply following market trends, Manu
sought to shape them. He invested heavily in market
research, closely monitoring consumer behavior, design
trends, and economic indicators. This proactive approach
enabled MSI to stay ahead of competitors by introducing
innovative products that resonated with emerging
consumer tastes.
For instance, recognizing the growing interest in
sustainable and eco-friendly materials, MSI expanded its
product line to include a variety of environmentally
responsible options. The company introduced recycled
glass surfaces and responsibly sourced stones, appealing to

ffl

ff

308

a market increasingly concerned with sustainability. This
strategic move not only captured new customer segments
but also reinforced MSI's reputation as an industry
innovator committed to social responsibility.

Harnessing Technological Advancements for
Competitive Edge
Technolo y played a pivotal role in MSI's growth, and
Manu's willingness to embrace and invest in technological
advancements set the company apart from its competitors.
Early on, Manu recognized that technolo y could
streamline operations, enhance product quality, and
improve customer service.
In the 1980s, MSI was among the rst in the industry to
adopt computerized inventory management systems. This
innovation allowed for more e cient tracking and
distribution of products, reducing costs and improving
delivery times. As e-commerce began to emerge, MSI
quickly developed an online presence, creating a userfriendly platform that made it easier for customers to
browse products, place orders, and access support
services.
Manu also leveraged technolo y in product development.
He invested in advanced fabrication techniques and
machinery that improved the precision and quality of MSI's
products. The integration of cutting-edge technologies like
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines and waterjet
cutting systems enabled MSI to o er customized solutions,
catering to the speci c needs and preferences of clients

commercial developers.
Moreover, MSI utilized data analytics to gain deeper
insights into market trends and customer behavior. By
analyzing sales data and customer feedback, the company
c o u l d m a ke i n f o r m e d d e c i s i o n s a b o u t p ro d u c t
development, marketing strategies, and expansion plans.
This data-driven approach ensured that MSI remained
responsive and adaptive in a rapidly changing market
environment.

Strategic Global Expansion and Supply Chain
Mastery
Manu's strategic foresight was perhaps most evident in
MSI's global expansion and supply chain development.
Recognizing the importance of diversifying supply sources
and accessing high-quality materials at competitive prices,
Manu embarked on building a robust international supply
network.
In the early 1990s, MSI expanded its sourcing operations
to countries rich in natural stone resources, such as China,
Turkey, Brazil, India, and Vietnam. Manu personally
traveled to these regions, forging strong relationships with
local quarry owners and manufacturers. He understood
that building trust and mutual respect with suppliers was
crucial for securing consistent quality and favorable terms.
These relationships were built on principles of fairness
and collaboration. MSI ensured timely payments and
310

provided support to suppliers during economic downturns
or local crises, fostering loyalty and reliability. This
approach not only secured a steady supply of diverse and
high-quality materials but also enabled MSI to negotiate
better pricing, which translated into competitive
advantages in the marketplace.
To optimize distribution, Manu strategically established
warehouses and distribution centers near major ports and
transportation hubs across the United States. This network
facilitated e cient logistics, reduced delivery times, and
improved service levels. MSI's ability to quickly and reliably
deliver products became a key di erentiator, attracting and
retaining a broad customer base that included retailers,
contractors, and designers.
Furthermore, Manu invested in developing a responsive
and exible supply chain capable of adapting to global
economic uctuations and geopolitical challenges. MSI
implemented robust risk management strategies, including
diversifying suppliers and maintaining inventory bu ers,
ensuring operational continuity even during times of
disruption such as natural disasters or trade disputes.

Cultivating a People-Centric Organizational
Culture
At the heart of MSI's success was Manu's unwavering
commitment to cultivating a strong, people-centric
organizational culture. He believed that a motivated and
loyal workforce was essential for executing the company's
vision and delivering exceptional customer service.

training programs to develop employees' skills and
knowledge, encouraging them to innovate and take
ownership of their roles. Open communication was
emphasized, with channels for feedback and ideas readily
available, ensuring that every team member felt valued and
heard.
One of Manu's notable policies was his commitment to
job security. Even during economic downturns, MSI
maintained a no-layo policy, opting instead to nd
creative solutions to retain and support its employees. This
approach built tremendous loyalty and morale within the
company, resulting in low turnover rates and a highly
engaged workforce dedicated to the company's success.
Additionally, Manu championed diversity and inclusion,
recognizing that a diverse team brings a wealth of
perspectives and ideas that drive innovation. MSI's
workforce represented a tapestry of cultures and
backgrounds, mirroring the global nature of its operations
and customer base. This diversity was celebrated and
leveraged to foster creativity and problem-solving across
the organization.

and exploring new market segments. MSI expanded into
commercial projects and introduced more a ordable
product lines, adjusting its strategies to meet the changing
market conditions.
Manu also emphasized operational e ciency during
challenging times. He scrutinized processes, eliminated
redundancies, and sought cost-saving opportunities
without compromising quality or employee well-being. This

The Underground Economy
Home Improvement and
Remodeling
This chapter explores how MSI navigates the fragmented home
improvement industry by adhering to ethical business practices,
even in regions where competitors operate within informal
economies. Despite potential short-term pro t losses, MSI prioritizes
integrity, safety, and transparency, refusing to compromise on
worker safety and regulatory compliance. This ethical approach has
sometimes limited MSI's market share in areas like California and
developing countries, but it underscores the company's commitment
to long-term, responsible business practices, setting a high standard
for the industry.

fi

318

When a home or condominium changes hands—whether
through the sale of an existing property or the purchase of
a new one—homeowners in the U.S. typically invest
between 5% to 20% of the property’s value on upgrades
and renovations. These improvements are often
concentrated in key areas such as the kitchen, master
bedroom, and bathrooms, where modernization e orts
focus on elements like kitchen cabinets, countertops,
ooring, lighting, and appliances. In suburban metro areas,
Big Box Retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, F&D, and
Menard’s dominate the market, capturing nearly 40% of
the business through their extensive network of
contractors.

he
home
improvement and
r e m o d e l i n g i n d u s t r y,
particularly in the United
States, is a complex and
fragmented landsc ape.
This complexity is further
magni ed in developing
countries around the
world, where the market
dynamics are often
in uenced by a myriad of
factors, including informal economies and regulatory
challenges. For a company like MSI, navigating this market
requires not only strategic vision but also a steadfast
commitment to ethical practices, even when faced with
signi cant market pressures.

However, the path to completing these home
improvements is rarely straightforward. In North America,
one signi cant aspect of remodeling—countertop
installation—illustrates the challenges within this market.
The cost to homeowners for a simple $10 per square foot
slab of material can escalate to around $45 per square foot
when installation fees and additional sales taxes are
included. This steep markup is not just a re ection of labor
costs; it also reveals the undercurrents of an informal,
underground economy that thrives on avoiding taxes and
regulatory oversight.

The Underground Economy: A Double-Edged
Sword
The underground economy in the home improvement
industry is particularly prevalent in densely populated
areas undergoing rapid change, such as North Hollywood in
Southern California, as well as major urban centers like
Chicago, Brooklyn, Queens, and Dallas. In these regions,
cash transactions to avoid sales tax and under-the-table
payments to workers are common practices. This system
allows some unethical contractors to circumvent wage
taxes, worker’s compensation costs, and overtime
premiums, creating a shadow economy that signi cantly
undermines legitimate businesses.
While these practices might o er short-term nancial
advantages for some contractors and homeowners, they
come with substantial long-term risks. The avoidance of
taxes and regulatory costs not only leads to a signi cant
loss of revenue for local governments but also perpetuates

fi

fi

fi

fl

ff

fi

320

a cycle of unlicensed work and inadequate safety measures.
This environment increases the risks for both workers and
homeowners, who may nd themselves without recourse if
something goes wrong.
For MSI, a company that has always prioritized ethical
business practices, the decision to steer clear of high-risk
markets where the underground economy is rampant has
been a deliberate one. While this choice has sometimes
meant sacri cing potential market share in regions like
Mexico, India, and Turkey, it underscores MSI’s unwavering
commitment to integrity and regulatory compliance.

The Human Cost of the Underground Economy
Beyond the nancial implications, the underground
economy has a profound human cost, particularly for
undocumented workers in the home nishing industry. In
regions like Southern California, these workers often
operate in hazardous conditions without proper protective
measures. The lack of safety equipment, such as N95
masks, exposes them to severe health risks like silicosis—a
debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling ne silica
particles. Silicosis is not just a risk; it is a reality for many
workers in developing countries like China, Mexico, and
Brazil, where safety regulations are lax or poorly enforced.
In the U.S., the situation is equally dire for undocumented
workers, who have limited access to healthcare and legal
protections.
These workers, often employed under the table, face a
grim reality. They work in unsafe environments with little
to no recourse if they are injured or fall ill. Without the
protection of legal status, many are forced to continue

working in dangerous conditions, unable to voice their
concerns or seek redress. When health issues arise, their
only option may be to seek compensation through legal
channels, a process that is often lengthy, stressful, and
fraught with uncertainty. MSI’s refusal to participate in the
underground economy highlights the company’s broader
commitment to addressing these issues, ensuring that its
business practices do not contribute to such exploitation.

MSI’s Ethical Stance and Strategic Decisions
The decision by MSI to avoid engaging with the
underground economy has had far-reaching implications
for the company’s market position. While some
competitors may have gained market share by cutting
corners, MSI has remained steadfast in its commitment to
legal and ethical business practices. This approach, led by
the Shah family, has ensured that MSI remains compliant
with all legal requirements, even when it means foregoing
potential pro ts in high-risk areas.
In California, particularly in high-cost housing markets,
MSI’s ethical stance has sometimes resulted in a smaller
market share compared to companies willing to engage in
questionable practices. However, the company’s leadership
has no regrets about this approach. For MSI, maintaining
integrity and adhering to ethical standards is not just a
business decision—it is a core value that de nes the
company’s identity.

The Ongoing Challenge of Ethical Business
Practices
The challenges of navigating the fragmented and
complex home improvement market are ongoing. In
regions where the underground economy thrives,
businesses like MSI face di cult choices: engage in
practices that compromise their values or risk losing out to
less scrupulous competitors. For MSI, the choice has always
been clear. The company’s commitment to ethical
practices, safety standards, and transparency has allowed it
to navigate this complex landscape successfully, even if it
meant sacri cing short-term gains for long-term integrity.
As the industry continues to
evolve, MSI’s approach serves
as a model for how businesses
can succeed without
compromising their values. By
avoiding the pitfalls of the
underground economy, MSI
has ensured its long-term
sustainability and set a
standard for ethical business
conduct in the home improvement and remodeling market.
The company’s success is a testament to the power of
integrity in business, proving that it is possible to achieve
growth and pro tability while staying true to core values.

1. The Rise of the Underground Economy (1970s-Present):
The underground economy, where businesses operate outside of
regulatory oversight, has been a persistent challenge, especially in
industries like construction and home improvement. This trend
gained momentum during economic downturns, where cash-based
transactions and unregulated labor became more prevalent. MSI's

understanding of the long-term risks and challenges associated with
these informal economies, prioritizing ethical business conduct over
short-term gains.
2. The Evolution of Home Improvement Trends: As home
improvement became increasingly popular, especially in the 1980s
and beyond, many homeowners sought cost-saving measures that
contributed to the growth of the underground economy. MSI’s
commitment to maintaining legal compliance and safety standards
re ects how some companies chose to navigate this landscape with
integrity, despite the pressures to compete with unregulated
businesses.

Supply Chain and Resilience
This chapter highlights Manu Shah's focus on the importance of a
strong, diversi ed supply chain in MSI's success, likening it to
strategic military campaigns. By developing global supplier
relationships and driving continuous innovation, MSI has built a
resilient supply chain capable of weathering economic downturns,
trade disruptions, and global crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and
the 2022 shipping crisis. Manu's strategic foresight, adaptability,
and emphasis on resilience have been key in turning challenges into
opportunities, ensuring MSI's long-term growth and positioning the
company for continued success.

or Manu Shah, the importance of a robust supply
chain in business success has always been clear. He
often draws lessons from history, likening business
strategies to military campaigns. In his view, the strength of
a supply chain can make or break a company, much like it
did for historical gures such as Alexander the Great and
Napoleon Bonaparte. "No matter how strong your product
is, without a reliable supply chain, you can't sustain
growth," Manu often says. He is fascinated by how
Alexander's overextended supply lines led to his retreat,
despite his military genius, and how Napoleon's invasion of
Russia was doomed partly because of logistical failures.
These historical insights resonate deeply with Manu,
shaping his approach to business.
At MSI, this understanding translated into a meticulous
focus on supply chain management from day one. "We
sourced materials globally, ensuring we had multiple
suppliers for each product," he explains. This strategic
diversi cation was not just about securing supplies; it was
about building resilience. By having a wide network of
suppliers, MSI mitigated risks associated with dependency
on any single source, ensuring that high-quality materials
were always available, no matter the global circumstances.
The supply chain, for MSI, was not just a logistical necessity
but the backbone of its operations, enabling the company
to scale and thrive in competitive markets.
Manu’s dedication to a strong supply chain was matched
by his commitment to continuous improvement and
innovation. He recognized early on that standing still was
not an option in a rapidly changing global economy. "We

Resilience in the Face of Economic Downturns
The resilience of MSI’s supply chain was put to the test
during economic downturns, times when many businesses
struggled to stay a oat. Manu’s approach during these
periods was marked by strategic foresight and an
unwavering commitment to his workforce. The 2008
nancial crisis, for instance, saw many companies resorting
to layo s to cut costs. MSI, however, took a di erent path.
"We didn’t cut jobs; instead, we focused on optimizing our
supply chain and maintaining quality," Manu recalls. This
decision was not just about keeping the lights on; it was
about preserving the integrity of the company and the
loyalty of its employees. By ensuring job security, MSI
fostered a stable, motivated workforce that was crucial in
navigating the challenges of the recession and positioning

ad o p t i o n o f c u t t i n g- e d ge te c h n o l o g i e s a n d t h e
implementation of streamlined processes across the board.
Digital tools revolutionized order processing, while logistics
optimization reduced bottlenecks, making the supply chain
more agile and responsive. But innovation at MSI wasn’t
con ned to technolo y; it extended to how the company
managed relationships with its suppliers. Manu believed
that strong, transparent partnerships were crucial. "We
worked closely with our suppliers to ensure they met our
high standards consistently," he notes, adding that this
collaborative approach not only fostered loyalty but also
ensured that MSI could adapt quickly to any changes in the
supply landscape.

the company for recovery when the economy began to
improve.
Manu’s belief in building a resilient organization went
beyond supply chain management; it was about instilling a
culture of adaptability and continuous improvement across
MSI. "We fostered a culture where adaptability was key,
where continuous improvement was not just encouraged
but expected," he explains. This culture meant that MSI was
always ready to respond to changes in the market, whether
it was the emergence of new competitors or shifts in
consumer demand. The company’s ability to pivot quickly
and e ectively was a testament to this ingrained resilience,
allowing MSI to not only survive but thrive in a volatile
business environment.

Navigating Global Challenges: The 2019 2022
Storms
The years between 2019 and 2022 were particularly
challenging for MSI, marked by a series of global
disruptions that tested the company’s resilience like never
before. The imposition of tari s on quartz slabs from China
in 2019 was the rst of these challenges. The U.S. tari s,
part of a broader trade war, forced MSI to rethink its
sourcing strategies almost overnight. Manu responded with
characteristic foresight, diversifying the company’s supply
chain by partnering with new suppliers in countries such as
India, Turkey, and Vietnam. This strategic pivot not only
mitigated the immediate impact of the tari s but also
strengthened MSI’s supply chain resilience in the long
term.

The following year brought new complications as the U.S.
imposed additional tari s on porcelain tiles from China, a
key product in MSI’s portfolio. Once again, Manu’s
proactive approach ensured that the company could
navigate these challenges without signi cant disruption. By
accelerating e orts to diversify its supply base and
exploring new partnerships in Europe, Latin America, and
Southeast Asia, MSI was able to secure a steady supply of
high-quality materials at competitive prices. This ability to
adapt quickly to changing trade environments was a
hallmark of MSI’s resilience, demonstrating how the
company could turn potential setbacks into opportunities
for growth.
But the challenges didn’t stop with tari s. The global
Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 2021 brought unprecedented
disruptions to economic activities worldwide, a ecting
every aspect of business from production to logistics. For
MSI, the pandemic tested the limits of its operational
capabilities. Yet, thanks to its strong digital infrastructure,
the company was able to transition smoothly to remote
work, maintaining operational continuity even as other
businesses struggled. MSI also ramped up its e-commerce
capabilities to meet the changing behaviors of consumers
who were increasingly shopping online. "Our strong
relationships with suppliers and customers were crucial
during this time," Manu re ects. These relationships
ensured clear communication and support, enabling MSI to
navigate the crisis with minimal disruption.
The global shipping crisis of 2022 added another layer of
complexity, characterized by container shortages, port

threatened to delay deliveries and increase costs for MSI,
potentially disrupting the company’s ability to meet
customer demands. However, Manu’s proactive measures,
including securing long-term contracts with shipping lines
and optimizing logistics, helped minimize these impacts.
By investing in advanced supply chain technologies to
improve visibility and e ciency, MSI was able to maintain
its service levels and customer satisfaction despite the
challenging circumstances.

The Strategic Response to Geopolitical
Tensions and Future Outlook
As if the previous challenges weren’t enough, 2024
brought new geopolitical tensions that further tested MSI’s
resilience. The blockages in the Red Sea, a critical maritime
route for global trade, posed signi cant threats to MSI’s
supply chain, especially for goods sourced from Asia and
the Middle East. Manu’s response was swift and decisive.
MSI rerouted shipments through alternative maritime
routes and increased the use of air freight for critical
supplies. Additionally, the company enhanced its inventory
management practices to bu er against potential delays,
ensuring that the impact on costs and customer deliveries
was minimized.
The adaptability and resilience that Manu had instilled in
MSI’s operations were once again on full display. These
qualities, coupled with a strategic vision and an unwavering
commitment to innovation, enabled MSI to not only
weather these storms but to come out stronger on the other

fi

side. The company’s ability to pivot, diversify its supply
chain, and leverage technolo y ensured continued growth,
even in the face of external pressures that would have
crippled less prepared organizations.
MSI’s journey through these turbulent years is a
testament to the power of resilience, adaptability, and
strategic foresight. Despite the numerous challenges, MSI’s
sales doubled over three years—a remarkable achievement
that speaks to the company’s ability to stay agile, focus on
core strengths, and continuously seek opportunities for
improvement. Manu’s belief that resilience is about more
than just surviving challenges; it’s about thriving despite
them, is a philosophy that has guided MSI through its most
challenging periods and will continue to shape its future
success.

Conclusion: Lessons Learned and the Road
Ahead
The journey through tari s, a global pandemic, and a
shipping crisis highlighted several key lessons for MSI:
Adaptability: The ability to pivot quickly in response to
changing circumstances is crucial for survival and growth.
Diversi cation: A diverse supply chain and market
presence can mitigate risks and provide stability.
Digital Readiness: Investing in technolo y and digital
capabilities enhances operational resilience and customer
engagement.

also positioned the company for continued success in the
future. As Manu likes to say, "Every challenge is an
opportunity to learn and grow." This mindset, deeply
ingrained in MSI’s culture, ensures that the company is
always ready to face whatever challenges come its way,
turning obstacles into opportunities and threats into
stepping stones towards greater achievements.

relationships, M S
International, Inc.
(MSI) stands out by
treating suppliers not
just as vendors but as
vital partners in its
business ecosystem.
Under Manu's
leadership and expanded involvement by Raj & Rup, MSI
has innovated its supply chain management by integrating
principles of partnership, fairness, and strategic foresight.
This chapter explores how MSI’s innovative approach to
supplier relationships enhances e ciency, reliability, and
mutual growth.

Building Strong Supplier Relationships
The Partnership Philosophy
MSI’s approach to supply chain management is based on
the principle that treating suppliers as partners creates a
more productive and sustainable business model. By
demanding cost reductions in exchange for increased
volume, MSI ensures that its suppliers are motivated to
improve e ciency while also bene ting from higher order
quantities. This strate y not only drives down costs but also

fi

ffi

g

ffi

338

fosters a collaborative relationship where both parties are
invested in each other’s success.

Financial Strategies and Timely Payments
Enhancing Supplier Stability
Understanding the nancial landscapes in countries like
China, India, Turkey, Brazil, and Vietnam, where interest
rates are typically higher than in the U.S., MSI opts to pay
its suppliers the day after shipment rather than demanding
extended credit terms. This practice not only adheres to
the American principle of "No Free Lunch" but also ensures
supplier loyalty and nancial stability, which is crucial for
maintaining a smooth supply chain.

Support During Challenges
Recognizing that challenges such as natural disasters,
strikes, or rapid expansions can strain suppliers, MSI
extends nancial support when needed. This support might
include loans to help suppliers through tough times or to
assist with expansions like adding new plants or
equipment. Such actions solidify MSI’s role as a supportive
partner, reinforcing the idea that suppliers’ challenges are
MSI’s challenges.

Logistical Innovations
MSI constantly seeks innovative logistical solutions to
reduce costs and improve e ciency. This includes
strategies like maximizing container loads to 26 tons near

ffi

fi

fi

fi

339

ports rather than using inland transportation, which can be
more expensive. By developing overseas suppliers with
direct ocean routes to strategic destinations, MSI minimizes
freight costs and enhances delivery reliability.

Leveraging Technolo y in Supply Chain
Management
MSI integrates technolo y at every step of the supply
chain process, from using digital photography and vendor
portals for paperwork to managing its custom clearance
processes. This high level of technological adoption
ensures error-free submissions and quick status updates,
which are crucial for e ective supply chain management.

Proactive Monitoring and Communication
Keeping a Pulse on Global Movements
MSI maintains a highly visible import map that depicts all
ships' locations, the number of containers on them for MSI
by product line, and their custom statuses. This enables
MSI to proactively manage its inventory and communicate
e ectively with large customers, ensuring they are always
informed of potential delays or issues.

Embracing Globalization in
American Markets
This chapter highlights MSI's strategic embrace of globalization
and containerized shipping, which positioned the company as a
leader in the surfacing industry. By building strong global supplier
relationships and leveraging containerized cargo, MSI created a
cost-e ective, streamlined supply chain that bene ted rural
economies and made luxury materials a ordable for American
homes. This approach allowed the company to quickly adapt to
market demands, fostering economic growth while maintaining
innovation and operational e ciency.

fi

ff

ffi

ff

343

he latter part of the
20th century
marked a signi cant shift in
global trade dynamics,
greatly in uenced by
political and economic
policies in the United
States. During the
presidencies of Ronald
Reagan and his successors,
a clear commitment to free
trade shaped the future of
international commerce. This era was characterized by an
increasing embrace of containerized cargo, which
revolutionized how goods were transported globally,
making it feasible to ship diverse products from the farthest
corners of the world directly to American cities.

The Impac t of G eneralized System of
Preferences (GSP)
A pivotal development during this period was the
implementation of the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP), a trade program designed to promote economic
growth in the developing world by providing preferential
duty-free entry for up to 4,800 products from 129
designated bene ciary countries and territories. The
reduction or elimination of tari s under GSP meant that
products essential for home surfacing, such as tiles and
natural stone, could be imported into the United States at
signi cantly lower costs.

fl

fi

344

MSI and the Wave of Global Trade
MSI's growth trajectory was closely aligned with these
changes in global trade policies. As tari s lowered, Manu
saw an opportunity to expand MSI's import portfolio to
include a broader array of products from developing
countries, thereby passing on cost savings to American
consumers. This strategic alignment with global trade
trends allowed MSI to o er competitive pricing without
compromising on quality, catering to the burgeoning
demands of America's middle class.

Containerized Cargo: Changing the Game
The
advent
of
containerized shipping
was another game
changer. It allowed for
the e cient and secure
transport of goods across
oceans. MSI leveraged
this innovation to
streamline its operations,
reduce damages during
transit, and ensure
timely delivery of
materials. The ability to ship products in 20-foot containers
from places like India, Brazil, and China directly to
metropolitan areas in the U.S. not only reduced overhead
costs but also minimized the environmental impact
associated with shipping.

Economic Policies and Business Strate y
The economic policies of the 1980s and 1990s underlined
the importance of understanding and adapting to
governmental economic strategies. MSI’s growth was not
just about recognizing market needs but also about
anticipating how changes in policy could a ect those
needs. By aligning its business model with these broader
economic policies, MSI ensured its relevance and resilience
in a rapidly globalizing market.

Globalization and the Rise of Containerized
Cargo: A Revolution in World Trade
The story of globalization is deeply intertwined with the
development of containerized cargo, a transformative
innovation that has reshaped world trade and supply
chains over the last century. For MSI and its global
operations, containerization has played a pivotal role in
expanding their product reach across continents, ensuring
that goods manufactured in the most remote parts of the
world can be delivered seamlessly to the doorsteps of
American homes and businesses.

The Origin of Containerized Cargo
Containerization was rst introduced in 1956 by an
American trucker and entrepreneur, Malcolm McLean,
who invented the standardized shipping container. Before
this innovation, cargo was loaded and unloaded piece by
piece, a slow, labor-intensive, and costly process. McLean’s

invention
of
containerized cargo
not only reduced
shipping costs
drastically but also
made international
trade much faster,

e cient.

By the 1970s, container ships became a global standard,
leading to the creation of an intricate web of shipping
routes and ports that today facilitate 90% of the world's
trade. Global trade, especially between developing and
developed countries, surged, and companies like MSI
seized this opportunity to connect rural producers to
global markets.

How Cargo Moves: From a Small Village in
North India to Big Box Stores in America
The journey of a product from a rural village in India to
an American big-box store, like Home Depot, is a
sophisticated and well-orchestrated process of logistics and

manufactured or sourced. After being processed or mined
locally, the products are transported by truck or smaller
vehicles to a regional hub, where they are consolidated and
packaged into shipping containers.
2. Rail Transport to Major Port (Mundra)
Once the goods are packaged, the containers are loaded
onto trains that head to Mundra Port, India’s largest
private port. Mundra, located on the western coast of India,
is a critical gateway for international trade. The containers,
now sealed and standardized, make this journey e ciently,
ensuring minimal handling of the cargo.
3. Port to Port: Mundra to U.S. East and West Coasts
At Mundra Port, the containers are transferred onto
large container ships that travel across the Indian Ocean,
the Arabian Sea, and eventually through the Suez Canal to
the U.S. east or west coasts. Major ports such as Los
Angeles, Long Beach, Newark, and Savannah receive
the containers, where they are unloaded onto rail cars for
further inland distribution.
4. Train Transport to Distribution Centers and
Stores
From the U.S. ports, the containers are transferred to
trains that carry them thousands of miles across the
country. Some may head directly to large distribution
centers, while others go straight to retailers. For example, a
container carrying MSI products may arrive in the Midwest,

ffi

348

from where it is distributed to as many as 2,000 big-box
stores such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menard’s.
5. Last-Mile Delivery
Once the containers reach the regional distribution
hubs, the goods are sorted, repackaged if necessary, and
sent to individual stores or directly to customers. This nal
leg of the journey, called **last-mile delivery**, ensures that
the product arrives at its destination promptly, completing
a journey that spans thousands of miles and multiple
modes of transport.

The Impact of Containerization on World
Trade
Containerization has been one of the greatest drivers of
globalization, fundamentally changing how goods are
produced, transported, and consumed. Here's how:
E ciency and Cost Reduction:
Containerized shipping has made global trade cheaper
by reducing the labor and time involved in moving goods.
Ports can now handle thousands of containers in a day,
making global supply chains faster and more responsive to
demand.
Standardization:
The standardized sizes of containers (20-foot and 40foot containers) mean that products can be seamlessly
transferred between ships, trucks, and trains without
repackaging, signi cantly reducing the risk of damage and
theft.

Global Integration of Economies:
Containerization has played a critical role in the rise of
global supply chains. Products can now be manufactured in
one part of the world, assembled in another, and sold in yet
another part of the world. This has integrated developing
economies into the global market, creating jobs, raising
incomes, and boosting economic growth.
Scale and Reach:
Globalization, powered by containerization, has
allowed companies like MSI to source materials from rural
areas in countries like India, China, Brazil, and Turkey and
deliver them to consumers in America. This ability to scale
operations globally has made MSI a leader in the industry
and a key player in global trade.

How MSI Navigated the Global Trade Network
MSI’s leadership in the surfacing industry was made
possible by understanding and leveraging the global
containerized shipping network. By developing deep
relationships with suppliers across 35 countries, MSI was
able to create a seamless supply chain where products
could be e ciently moved from quarries and factories to
homes and businesses in the U.S.
Moreover, with the rise of containerization, MSI was able
to constantly increase its volume of purchases while
decreasing the cost per unit, allowing for more a ordable
and accessible products. The Sourcing and Purchasing
Strate y of paying suppliers upon shipment and
maintaining transparency in the supply chain further

ff

ffi

g

strengthened MSI’s global footprint, making it a trusted
partner for suppliers and customers alike.

Conclusion: A Global Revolution in Trade
Containerized cargo has revolutionized world trade,
allowing companies like MSI to grow from local businesses
into global players. By leveraging this innovation, MSI has
been able to build a strong, scalable supply chain that links
rural producers to global consumers, enabling growth and
prosperity across borders. In a world where globalization
continues to drive economic integration, containerization
remains at the heart of modern commerce, facilitating the
seamless movement of goods across continents.

The Global Impact of Containerized Cargo:
Jobs and A ordable Goods
Containerized cargo has not only revolutionized the way
goods are shipped worldwide but also fundamentally
changed the dynamics of employment and pricing,
particularly in rural areas. For companies like MSI, the use
of containerized shipping has facilitated the creation of
hundreds of thousands of jobs in regions that were
previously disconnected from global supply chains. At the
same time, it has driven down costs, making products more
a ordable for consumers across the globe.

ff

ff

351

Creating Jobs in Rural Areas
Before the advent of containerization, rural areas in
developing countries often struggled to connect with the
global economy due to ine cient, costly, and unreliable
shipping methods. Containerization changed this by
enabling companies to ship goods from the remotest parts
of the world directly to international markets, providing
rural economies with new avenues for growth.
For MSI, which sources natural stone, tiles, and other
surfacing materials from 35 countries, containerized
shipping has been the cornerstone of their ability to
integrate rural producers into the global market. Today, in
2024, MSI supports over 400,000 jobs, with more than
75% of those jobs in rural areas. By partnering with local
quarries, factories, and artisans in countries such as India,
Brazil, Turkey, and China, MSI has enabled rural
communities to participate in the global economy,
providing stable employment, improved infrastructure,
and higher living standards.

Boosting Rural Economies and Enhancing
Livelihoods
The introduction of containerized shipping has allowed
these rural areas to become key players in global supply
chains, driving investment and economic development. As
MSI's volume of orders increased, so did the demand for
skilled labor, infrastructure, and logistics services in these
rural areas. The ability to transport large quantities of
materials through standardized containers allowed for

ffi

352

economies of scale, which in turn generated more jobs in
production, transportation, and related industries.
Additionally, as companies in these regions gained access
to global markets through containerized shipping, they
were able to improve their production processes and raise
quality standards, further boosting their competitiveness
and capacity to provide consistent employment. This
steady source of income has transformed many rural
economies, creating opportunities for education,
healthcare, and better living conditions.

Lowering Costs for Consumers
Containerized cargo has also dramatically reduced the
cost of shipping goods, leading to lower prices for
consumers. By standardizing the way products are
transported and reducing the time and labor involved in
loading and unloading cargo, containerization has slashed
shipping costs. For MSI, this e ciency means that the
company can move vast quantities of goods at lower perunit costs, passing the savings onto consumers.
With its strategic use of containerization, MSI has been
able to make products such as granite, porcelain tiles, and
quartz countertops more accessible and a ordable to a
broader audience. As a result, homeowners and businesses
can now enjoy high-quality, durable materials at prices that
were previously unattainable. In the U.S., MSI products
have become a staple in home improvement projects, with
competitive pricing making luxury materials like natural
stone more accessible to middle-class families.

The Future of Containerized Cargo at MSI
As global trade continues to evolve, containerized cargo
remains a critical tool for ensuring the continued ow of
goods between rural producers and urban consumers.
MSI's leadership in leveraging this system has enabled the
company to grow its reach, support hundreds of thousands
of jobs, and reduce costs for its customers.
By continuing to innovate and expand its global network,
MSI is poised to maintain its position as a leader in the
surfacing industry, all while supporting rural economies
and delivering high-quality, a ordable products to
customers worldwide. This is a testament to how
containerization has transformed both business and
society, fostering economic development and bringing the
world closer together.

MSI's No Layo s Policy

A Commitment to Stability
This chapter highlights MSI's "No Layo s for Lack of Work"
policy, established by Manu and Rika Shah in response to Manu's
personal experience during the 1970s auto industry recession. The
policy re ects a deep commitment to employee security,
emphasizing long-term well-being over short-term nancial gains.
MSI upholds this principle through careful planning, nancial
discipline, and humility, fostering loyalty and protecting talent.
This approach has enabled MSI to sustain growth and remain
resilient, positioning the company as a model for stability during
economic challenges.

fi

fi

ff

ff

fl

372

n the late 1970s, the American auto industry was hit
hard by a severe recession, leading to widespread
layo s that shook the stability of countless families. Manu
Shah, then working as an engineer in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
experienced this turbulent period rsthand. On a Friday
morning in 1975, Manu was handed a pink slip—his notice of
layo . However, by the end of that same day, his
exceptional expertise in automation and testing spared him
from unemployment. While Manu's job was saved, he
witnessed over 200 of his colleagues, many of them
engineers and designers, being let go. The human cost of
these layo s—disrupted families, nancial insecurity, and
emotional turmoil—left a profound impact on Manu and his
wife, Rika.
It was during this period of uncertainty that Manu and
Rika made a pledge to themselves: if they were to build
their own company, layo s would be o the table, no
matter the circumstances. This personal vow laid the
foundation for MSI's enduring policy of "No Layo s for Lack
of Work," a policy that has stood strong for 49 years.

The Historical Context: The Recession of the
1970s
The 1970s were a tumultuous time for the American
economy, marked by stag ation, high unemployment, and
an ener y crisis that severely impacted the manufacturing
sector, particularly the auto industry. Companies across the
country resorted to mass layo s as a means of survival. The
widespread economic uncertainty created a ripple e ect,

ff

ff

fi

fi

ff

ff

fl

ff

g

ff

ff

373

leading to reduced consumer spending, further
exacerbating the challenges for businesses. In Fort Wayne,
Indiana, the heart of manufacturing, the human toll of
these layo s was evident, with families facing nancial
ruin, children uprooted from their schools, and entire
communities struggling to cope.
Manu's personal brush with unemployment during this
period was not just a professional challenge but a deeply
human experience. It opened his eyes to the real cost of
layo s—not just for the individuals directly a ected but for
their families, their communities, and the economy.

The True Cost of Layo s
While many companies see layo s as a necessary evil to
cut costs during tough times, the Shah family has always
viewed them as a last resort—one that comes with
signi cant, often overlooked, expenses. The nancial costs
to a company can be substantial, including severance pay,
extended healthcare bene ts for up to 12 months, and the
reduced productivity that comes with reassigning work to
remaining employees. Training or retraining employees to
take on additional duties can further strain resources.
Beyond the immediate nancial burden, layo s can lead
to long-term consequences that undermine the very
survival of a company. Downsizing often triggers a wave of
voluntary departures, as remaining employees, fearing for
their own job security, seek more stable opportunities
elsewhere. This attrition can drain a company of its most
valuable talent. Additionally, layo s can increase a
company’s unemployment insurance tax rates and expose

fi

fi

ff

ff

ff

ff

fi

fi

ff

fi

ff

374

But perhaps the most devastating cost of layo s is the
impact on the lives of the employees and their families.
Forced to relocate to nd new employment, families are
uprooted, with children having to adapt to new schools and
spouses needing to nd new jobs. Selling a home becomes
increasingly di cult in a market ooded with unemployed
workers, leading to nancial and emotional stress that can
take years to recover from.

MSI’s Enduring Commitment
Over the decades, MSI has weathered numerous
economic storms, including rece ssions, market
uctuations, and industry shifts. Through it all, the
company has remained steadfast in its commitment to
avoid layo s, driven by the belief that employees are the
most valuable asset a
company possesses.
This policy is not just
about protecting jobs—
it's about preserving
the integrity and
morale of the
workforce, ensuring
that every employee
feels secure in their
role and valued for
their contributions.

it to potential legal fees from lawsuits, further straining its
nancial resources.

The Shah family has never understood why layo s
continue to be a go-to strate y for many American
companies. In their view, the true cost of layo s far
outweighs any short-term nancial savings. By prioritizing
stability and security for its employees, MSI has fostered a
loyal, dedicated workforce that has been instrumental in
the company’s sustained growth and success.

No Layo Policy: The Pillars of Planning,
Discipline, and Humility
Implementing a no-layo policy, as MSI has done for
nearly ve decades, is not simply a matter of making a
promise; it requires careful planning, strict discipline, and
a deep sense of humility toward the workforce. These
principles are the bedrock upon which MSI’s no-layo
policy stands.

P l a n n i n g : Fo r e s e e i n g C h a l l e n ge s a n d
Preparing for the Future
A no-layo policy demands foresight and meticulous
planning. It requires a company to anticipate economic
downturns, market shifts, and potential disruptions. At
MSI, this means constantly monitoring the economic
landscape, industry trends, and internal nancial health.
The company must be prepared for lean times, building
reserves and creating exible strategies that allow it to
absorb shocks without resorting to layo s. This proactive
approach enables MSI to remain stable even during
turbulent periods, ensuring that the workforce is protected.

Discipline: Maintaining Financial Prudence
and Operational E ciency
Discipline is essential in upholding a no-layo policy. For
MSI, this means maintaining strict nancial prudence,
controlling costs, and optimizing operations to ensure the
company remains pro table even in challenging times. It
also involves making tough decisions about resource
allocation and investment, always with the long-term
stability of the workforce in mind. By avoiding unnecessary
expenditures and focusing on core business strengths, MSI
has been able to sustain its no-layo policy for nearly half a
century.

Humility: Recognizing the Value of Every
Employee
Humility is perhaps the most important element in MSI’s
approach to its workforce. The Shah family understands
that every employee, from the warehouse worker to the
executive team, plays a crucial role in the company’s
success. This recognition fosters a culture of mutual respect
and trust, where employees feel valued and secure in their
roles. It also means acknowledging that the company’s
leaders do not have all the answers and must be willing to
listen to and learn from their employees. This humility
helps to create a supportive environment where employees
are encouraged to grow, contribute, and thrive, knowing
that their job security is a top priority.

Conclusion: The Foundation of MSI’s No Layo
Policy
MSI’s no-layo policy is a testament to the company’s
commitment to its people. By integrating careful planning,
disciplined nancial management, and a humble approach
to leadership, MSI has created a resilient organization that
values its employees as its greatest asset. This policy not
only provides security to the workforce but also
strengthens the company, ensuring its continued success
and stability for years to come.
"True leadership is not just about steering the ship; it's
about ensuring everyone on board feels secure, valued,
and part of the journey—no matter the storms ahead."

Quotes:
Richard Branson: "Train people well enough so they can
leave, treat them well enough so they don't want to."
This quote re ects MSI's commitment to investing in its
employees, ensuring they feel valued, secure, and
motivated to stay, even when faced with economic
uncertainties.
Historical Context
1. The 1970s Economic Recession: The 1970s were marked by
a severe recession, stag ation, and an oil crisis, which had a
devastating impact on industries across the United States,
particularly the automotive sector. Manu Shah's experience with
layo s during this period in uenced his and Rika's commitment to

ff

fl

fl

ff

fi

ff

378

2. Shift Toward Employee-Centric Policies (1980sPresent): In response to economic downturns and corporate
scandals, many companies began to realize the importance of
treating employees as valuable assets rather than expendable
resources. MSI's long-standing no-layo policy mirrors this shift
towards more ethical, employee-focused management practices,
setting an example of stability and loyalty in a competitive business
landscape.
3. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008: During the 2008
nancial crisis, many companies resorted to mass layo s to survive,
but MSI's commitment to its no-layo policy demonstrated how
careful planning, nancial discipline, and a long-term vision could
help a company weather economic challenges without sacri cing its
workforce.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Cultural Values of Loyalty and Family: Indian
culture places a strong emphasis on loyalty, responsibility, and
treating employees as part of an extended family. MSI’s no-layo
policy re ects these values, fostering a sense of security, respect, and
belonging among employees, and ensuring that they are not seen as
mere numbers but as integral members of the company.
2. The American Ideal of Stability and Fairness: American
culture values fair treatment, job security, and opportunities for
growth. MSI's approach to maintaining job security aligns with this
cultural expectation, demonstrating that businesses can thrive while
upholding principles of fairness and commitment to their
workforce.

creating a company that would protect its employees from similar
hardships. MSI’s "No Layo s for Lack of Work" policy emerged from
this historical context, re ecting a desire to build a more secure and
resilient workplace.

3. Global Emphasis on Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR): In recent years, there has been a growing expectation for
companies to operate ethically and with a sense of social
responsibility. MSI's no-layo policy re ects this global trend,
showcasing how businesses can prioritize employee well-being and
contribute positively to society, even in challenging economic
climates.
Business Context
1. Talent Retention and Employee Morale: In the business
world, layo s can signi cantly impact employee morale and
productivity. Companies that resort to layo s often experience a loss
of trust, decreased engagement, and reduced loyalty among the
remaining employees. By maintaining a no-layo policy, MSI has
fostered a culture of stability and trust, leading to higher retention
rates and a more motivated workforce. This approach contributes to
long-term productivity, as employees are more willing to invest their
skills and e orts in a company that values their security and wellbeing.
2. Competitive Advantage in Attracting Talent: In an
environment where job security is often uncertain, MSI's
commitment to avoiding layo s provides a unique selling point in
the talent market. The policy not only attracts top talent looking for
stable employment but also sets MSI apart as a company that
genuinely cares for its workforce. This creates a competitive
advantage, helping MSI attract and retain skilled employees who are
more likely to contribute to the company's growth and success.
3. Financial Prudence and Long-Term Stability: While
many companies prioritize short-term nancial gains by cutting
costs through layo s, MSI's no-layo policy re ects a more strategic,
long-term approach. By practicing nancial discipline, building
reserves, and carefully planning for economic downturns, MSI has
ensured it can withstand market uctuations without resorting to
layo s. This approach has helped MSI remain nancially stable and

ff

fi

fl

ff

fl

fi

fl

ff

ff

ff

fi

ff

ff

ff

ff

380

resilient, even in challenging times, allowing it to capitalize on
market opportunities when competitors are weakened by workforce
reductions.
4. Enhanced Reputation and Brand Loyalty: In today's
business landscape, consumers and clients increasingly prefer to
engage with companies that demonstrate ethical practices and
social responsibility. MSI's no-layo policy not only strengthens its
internal culture but also enhances its external reputation as a
compassionate and trustworthy business. This positive image helps
build stronger relationships with customers, partners, and
stakeholders, contributing to MSI's brand loyalty and overall
market success.
5. Adaptability and Cross-Training: MSI's no-layo policy
has encouraged a culture of adaptability and cross-training within
the organization. During periods of low demand or economic
downturns, instead of laying o employees, MSI focuses on
upskilling and redeploying them into di erent roles. This strate y
ensures that the workforce remains agile, capable of adapting to
new challenges, and ready to support the company's growth as
market conditions improve.

Navigating Employee
Termination at MSI
This chapter discusses the careful and sensitive approach to
employee termination at MSI, a company committed to avoiding
layo s due to lack of work. Firing for cause (e.g., safety violations or
substance abuse) follows clear HR protocols, while performancerelated terminations require a more sensitive, thorough process.
MSI emphasizes respect, dignity, and ethical considerations during
terminations, ensuring they align with the company’s values. By
acknowledging the Peter Principle—where employees may reach
their competency limit—MSI frames terminations as opportunities
for employees to nd better-suited roles, turning a di cult situation
into a constructive transition.

ffi

fi

ff

382

t M S International,
Inc. (MSI), terminating
an employee is considered
one of the most challenging
responsibilities for leaders,
including Manu. Given MSI's
commitment to never laying
o employees due to lack of
work, terminations are
particularly sensitive and are
handled with the utmost care and consideration. This
chapter explores the di erent circumstances under which
terminations occur at MSI, the processes involved, and how
the company ensures these di cult decisions are handled
ethically and constructively.

F i r i n g f o r C a u s e : C l e a r Po l i c i e s a n d
Procedures
Handling Clear Violations
At MSI, terminations for cause are managed by Human
Resources and are relatively straightforward. Causes for
dismissal might include DUI, unsafe operation of
equipment, chronic tardiness, substance abuse,
harassment, theft, or misuse of company property. In such
cases, HR typically provides warnings followed by
termination if the employee does not improve. These
actions are documented carefully, ensuring that the
employee understands the severity of their actions and the
consequences. Manu believes that although tough, these

ffi

ff

ff

383

decisions often lead to better outcomes for the individual,
who may go on to improve in another place and new
environment.

P e r f o r m a n c e - R e l a t e d Te r m i n a t i o n : A
Thorough Approach
When Expectations Aren't Met
More challenging than ring for cause is terminating an
employee for failing to meet job expectations. This
situation requires careful documentation and a sensitive
approach. Manu emphasizes that such terminations are
akin to removing a slow-growing cancer that can in uence
and demoralize the rest of the team. The process typically
involves a meeting with HR present, where Manu
acknowledges the employee's talents but explains that they
may be better suited in a di erent role or organization " nding the right bus," as he puts it. This approach aims to
ensure that the departure is seen as an opportunity for the
employee to nd a position that better ts their skills and
aspirations.

Ethical Considerations and MSI’s Core Values
Maintaining Integrity and Respect
Manu is acutely aware of the impact of termination on an
individual's career and personal life. He strives to ensure
that each termination is handled with dignity, and the
employee leaves without harboring any grudge against the
company. This is aligned with MSI’s core values of respect

fl

fi

ff

fi

fi

fi

384

and integrity. Particularly in cases where an employee
might be engaging in activities that con ict with MSI's
interests, such as selling competing products, the necessity
for termination is clear, yet the process remains respectful.

The Peter Principle and Organizational Fit
Understanding Limits of Competency
MSI acknowledges the Peter Principle, which suggests
that employees often rise to their level of incompetence.
This principle is discussed openly, helping leaders and
employees understand that not every promotion or role is
suitable for every individual. This awareness helps frame
terminations not as personal failures but as mismatches
between role requirements and individual capabilities.

Conclusion: Compassionate Departures
In conclusion, while terminations are never easy, MSI
handles them with a focus on what is best for both the
individual and the company. By ensuring that terminations
are handled respectfully, ethically, and in alignment with
corporate values, MSI maintains its reputation as a fair and
principled employer. The goal is always to enable former
employees to transition smoothly to opportunities that
align better with their skills and career goals, thereby
turning a challenging situation into a constructive pathway
for future success.

Quote:
Aristotle: "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence,
then, is not an act but a habit." This quote aligns with MSI's
commitment to consistently handling terminations with
integrity, ensuring that their actions re ect the company's
core values and dedication to ethical practices.
Historical Context:
1. The Evolution of Employment Practices (1980sPresent): As businesses became more aware of employee rights and
the importance of ethical workplace practices, the process of
handling terminations evolved to become more structured,
transparent, and humane. MSI's approach to handling
terminations with dignity and respect aligns with this historical
trend, where companies increasingly recognized the value of
treating employees fairly, even during di cult transitions.
2. The Rise of HR Protocols and Legal Compliance: In
response to employment laws and regulations, companies have had
to adopt rigorous HR protocols to ensure terminations are handled
legally and ethically. MSI's adherence to clear policies and
procedures in cases of misconduct re ects how modern businesses
are required to maintain high standards of fairness, compliance,
and transparency.
3. The In uence of the Peter Principle (1969 Present): The
Peter Principle, introduced by Dr. Laurence J. Peter in 1969, gained
traction as a widely accepted concept in organizational behavior.
MSI's acknowledgment of this principle demonstrates an
understanding that not all employees are suited for every role, and

-

fl

ffi

fl

fl

386

terminating an employee can sometimes be a necessary step to
ensure both the individual's and the organization's success.
Cultural Context:
1. Indian Values of Compassion and Respect: In Indian
culture, treating others with compassion, respect, and dignity is
fundamental. MSI's approach to handling terminations with
empathy and a focus on the employee's future aligns with these
cultural values, emphasizing the belief that even in di cult
situations, actions should be taken with kindness and consideration.
2. American Business Culture's Focus on Fairness and
Transparency: The American workplace culture places a strong
emphasis on fairness, transparency, and clear communication,
especially regarding employee matters. MSI's e orts to maintain
integrity and respect during terminations re ect this cultural
expectation, ensuring that even in challenging circumstances, the
process is conducted in an ethical and considerate manner.
3. Global Shift Towards Ethical Business Practices: In
recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on corporate social
responsibility and ethical treatment of employees worldwide. MSI's
approach to terminations, where the focus is on nding a
constructive pathway for employees, resonates with this global
movement toward maintaining ethical standards and fostering a
positive workplace culture.

Raj & Rup
This chapter explores the leadership journey of Raj and Rup Shah
at MSI. Growing up immersed in the family business, they gained
external experience in investment banking before o cially joining
MSI in 2003. Their leadership has been instrumental in MSI’s
exponential growth in revenue, operations, and workforce.
Succession planning and mentoring by their father, Manu, have
ensured a smooth transition while maintaining MSI’s core values of
quality and integrity.

ffi

388

he story of Raj
and Rup Shah
stands as a testament to
the blend of legacy,
education, and forwardthinking that Manu and
Rika instilled in their
children. Both grew up
in the basement of RikaManu Home while mom
and dad were busy
exporting Electronic
Integrated Circuits, memory chips and Microprocessors,
they both watched what their parents were doing, helping
as much they can, opening mails, packaging export boxes
and so on. After moving to California in 1984 both wanted
to go to top schools. Both brothers eventually graduated
from Whitney High School, one of California's top high
schools, with Raj completing his education in 1992 and Rup
in 1995. Despite their father’s hopes of them becoming
engineers, they were drawn to the world of business,
in uenced by their mother's keen business acumen. Both
got admissions to the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania, a pinnacle of business
education in America.

Raj and Rup: Life Lessons and Wisdom Passed
Down from Their Parents
•
Parental Guidance: One of the important things
Manu did, which has been incredibly helpful to both Raj

fl

389

and Rup, was giving them the freedom to nd their own
paths. Rather than taking a direct approach and saying,
"This is how you should do things," he o ered them a great
deal of autonomy to explore and try things on their own.
Throughout their endeavors, he consistently provided
unwavering support, allowing them to learn and grow
independently.
•
Business Lessons: Raj and Rup often re ect on how
the simplest lessons are often the most impactful. Though
their father had no formal business training, he imparted
invaluable wisdom—lessons that, while di erent from what
might be taught at Wharton Business School, have been
proven to work time and again. His guiding principles were
clear: never carry debt, don’t take on more than you can
manage, make decisions that allow for a peaceful night's
sleep, always pay vendors a day early, and never give the
competition an opportunity. These simple yet profound
lessons have shaped their approach to business and
success.
•
Simplicity: Raj and Rup believe this is the most
important lesson they've learned from their parents.
Despite the family's incredible success and access to
anything they could want, they've always been taught to
remain humble. Many would agree that the Shah Family is
one of the humblest families, and this humility is rooted in
the example set by the Queen of the family.
•
Embracing New Ideas: Raj and Rup were taught
the importance of always being open to new ideas—another
way of saying, "Be adaptable." Their parents exempli ed
this adaptability throughout their lives, from growing up in

fi

fl

fi

ff

ff

390

a lower-class family in India, attending university in the
USA, entering a workforce in a completely di erent culture,
starting a business with little formal education, to raising a
family and moving to Southern California. Through all
these changes, they adapted and thrived. It's no surprise
that Raj and Rup have inherited this thirst for new ideas,
constantly learning, reading, and nding ways to be
adaptable in their own lives. While their journey may have
been easier than their parents', the core lesson remains:
always be open to growth and change.

Gaining External Experience: A Precept of
Practical Wisdom
Manu had always advocated for gaining external
experience before joining the family business. He believed
that being an employee before becoming an employer was
crucial for understanding the broader business landscape.
Adhering to this advice, both Raj and Rup ventured into
investment banking in Manhattan, the global hub of
business. Their roles in mergers and acquisitions helped
them understand how to e ectively manage income and
balance sheets, skills that were crucial for their future roles
at MSI.

The Decision to Join MSI
In late August 2002, a signi cant phone call from Raj to
his parents marked the beginning of a new chapter for MSI.
His conversation re ected his observations of MSI's strong
and transparent balance sheet, and his desire to bring his
expertise back to the family business. This was

ff

fi

fi

ff

fl

391

complemented by personal reasons, as his future wife,
Sona, an attorney, was based in Southern California. Raj
had already been an uno cial advisor to MSI, contributing
to strategic decisions such as the creation of an HR manual
and strategies for reaching big-box retailers in the home
improvement market.
Two weeks after Raj's call, Rup reached out with a similar
intention, asking if there was room for him as well. This
moment was overwhelmingly joyous for Manu and Rika, as
if they were " ying in the cloud." Manu excitedly outlined
32 projects that MSI could undertake but hadn't yet
pursued due to various constraints.

Joining Forces: Expanding MSI
On January 1, 2003, both brothers o cially joined MSI,
infusing the company with new ener y and perspectives.
Their arrival marked a signi cant acceleration in MSI's
growth trajectory. By 2007, under their combined
leadership, MSI's sales nearly reached $300 million, nearly
quadrupling in just four years. This period also saw the
expansion from 3 branches to 8, spreading across major
metropolitan areas like Chicago, Boston, and Houston, with
many more planned.

MSI's Continued Growth
The inclusion of Raj and Rup into MSI not only brought
new capabilities but also reinforced the company’s
foundations built by Manu and Rika. With a strong
emphasis on innovation, strategic expansion, and

g

ffi

fi

ffi

fl

392

maintaining the core values of the company, MSI continued
to grow. The brothers' backgrounds in nance and strate y
propelled MSI into new markets and product lines,
ensuring that the company’s legacy of quality and integrity
remained intact.

Exponential Growth Under Raj and Rup's
Leadership
Since Raj and Rup joined MSI in 2003, the company has
experienced extraordinary growth over the past twenty
years. By focusing on strategic expansion and operational
e ciency, they have spearheaded MSI's transformation into
a major industry player. Here are some key metrics
illustrating this growth:
• Revenue Growth: Under their leadership, MSI's
revenue has grown by an impressive 45 times, a
testament to their e ective management and expansion
strategies.
• Expansion of Sales and Service Centers: The
number of branches, including sales and service centers
in North America, has increased tenfold, enhancing MSI's
market presence and customer service capabilities.
• Increase in Container Tra c: Container tra c, a
crucial indicator of operational volume, has grown
twelvefold, re ecting the company's increased import
and export activities.

ffi

ff

fl

ffi

393

• Employee Growth: The workforce at MSI has
expanded eightfold, supporting the company's larger
operations and demonstrating its role as a signi cant
employer in the industry.
This remarkable growth not only underscores the
e ective leadership of Raj and Rup but also aligns with
Manu and Rika Shah's vision of creating a resilient and
innovative family business that could scale signi cantly
while maintaining its core values of quality and integrity.

A Family’s Vision Sustained
The story of Raj and Rup joining MSI is more than a
simple tale of succession—it is about the sustainability of a
vision across generations. It highlights the importance of
external experience and education in preparing the next
generation for leadership. For Manu and Rika, seeing their
sons contribute to and expand the family business was a
ful llment of their lifelong dreams and a testament to their
years of hard work and dedication. As MSI marched
forward, it continued to embody the principles of
innovation, quality, and family values, poised for future
challenges and opportunities.

Importance of Succession Planning
For any business, particularly a family-run enterprise like
MSI, succession planning is crucial. "Succession planning is
not just about passing the baton; it's about ensuring the
company's future stability and growth," Manu emphasizes.
E ective succession planning involves identifying and

fi

fi

fi

ff

ff

394

nurturing future leaders who can carry forward the
company's vision and values.
Succession planning at MSI started early. Manu and his
wife, Rika, were mindful of preparing their sons, Raj and
Rup, for leadership roles. "We wanted them to be ready, not
just to take over the business but to take it to new heights,"
Manu shares.

Identifying and Nurturing Future Leaders
Identifying potential leaders involves recognizing
individuals with the right skills, values, and commitment.
"Leadership is not just about skills; it's about integrity,
resilience, and the ability to inspire others," Manu explains.
At MSI, this process was particularly focused on Raj and
Rup, who showed early signs of leadership potential.
Manu's approach to nurturing future leaders included
providing opportunities for growth and learning. "We
encouraged our sons to explore di erent roles within the
company, to understand the business from the ground up,"
Manu says. This hands-on experience was critical in
shaping their leadership capabilities.

Manu's Approach to Mentoring His Sons
Mentoring is a vital component of preparing future
leaders. Manu's mentoring approach with his sons was both
structured and organic. "I believe in leading by example
and providing guidance when needed, but also giving them
the freedom to make their own decisions," he explains.

ff

395

One of Manu's key principles in mentoring was trust.
"Trust your children to make the right decisions," he
advises. "They might make mistakes, but those mistakes are
valuable learning experiences." This philosophy allowed
Raj and Rup to develop con dence and independence in
their leadership roles.

Challenges in Grooming the Next Generation
Grooming the next generation of leaders is not without
its challenges. One of the signi cant challenges is balancing
guidance with autonomy. "You want to provide support and
direction, but you also need to step back and let them nd
their own way," Manu notes.
Another challenge is ensuring that the future leaders
share the company's core values. "It's crucial that Raj and
Rup understand and uphold the values that MSI was built
on," Manu stresses. This involves continuous
communication and alignment on the company's vision and
mission.
Moreover, the transition of leadership can sometimes
create internal con icts. "It's natural for there to be some
resistance and adjustment during a leadership transition,"
Manu acknowledges. "The key is to manage these dynamics
with transparency and mutual respect."

Walmart’s Succession Planning
Walmart successfully continued its growth trajectory
when Rob Walton took over from his father, Sam Walton,
by maintaining the core values and strategic vision of the
company. Similarly, Ford Motor Company saw continued
success and managed challenging transitions under the
leadership of Henry Ford II, demonstrating the
e ectiveness of thorough preparation and the right
leadership qualities in maintaining a company’s legacy.

Manu's Re ections on Leadership and Legacy
Re ecting on his journey, Manu shares his thoughts on
leadership and legacy. "Leadership is about more than just
managing a business; it's about inspiring and empowering
others to achieve their best," he says. This belief has guided
his approach to preparing Raj and Rup for their roles at
MSI.
Manu also emphasizes the importance of legacy. "A true
legacy is not just what you achieve, but what you leave
behind for others to build upon," he explains. For Manu,
this means leaving behind a strong, resilient company that
continues to thrive and uphold the values he holds dear.

Conclusion
Manu's approach to preparing the next generation of
leaders at MSI is a testament to his commitment to the
company's future. By identifying potential leaders early,

fl

fl

ff

397

providing them with growth opportunities, and mentoring
them with trust and guidance, he has ensured that MSI
remains in capable hands. His story serves as an inspiration
to other family-run businesses, highlighting the importance
of succession planning and the lasting impact of e ective
leadership.

Cultural Context
1. Asian Family Business Values: Raj and Rup Shah's journey
within MSI re ects a strong cultural emphasis on family loyalty,
respect for elders, and the importance of legacy, which are central
values in many Asian cultures. The concept of a family business
passing from one generation to the next is deeply ingrained, where
each generation is expected to build upon the foundation laid by
their predecessors, enhancing the family's reputation and ensuring
its long-term success.
2. The Value of Education: The emphasis on Raj and Rup's
education at prestigious institutions like the Wharton School of
Business represents a cultural value common in many Asian
communities, where academic excellence is viewed as a path to
success and a means of ensuring the family's prosperity. Their
external experience in investment banking before joining MSI
highlights the belief in gaining practical skills and outside
perspectives, which can later be applied to strengthen the family
enterprise.

to mentoring his sons by encouraging hands-on experience and
leading by example aligns with a cultural belief in experiential
learning. This method fosters resilience, independence, and a deep
understanding of the business, ensuring that the next generation is
well-prepared to take on leadership roles.
4. Adaptability and Innovation: The success of Raj and Rup in
expanding MSI re ects an adaptability and willingness to embrace
change, which is a signi cant aspect of immigrant culture in
America. Their ability to blend traditional values with innovative
strategies is a testament to the adaptability that many immigrant
families demonstrate when building businesses in a new
environment.
5. Blending Eastern and Western Business Practices: Raj and
Rup's leadership journey at MSI showcases a fusion of Eastern and
Western business philosophies. While they honor the core values of
integrity, family loyalty, and respect instilled by their parents, they
also adopt Western practices of strategic planning, data-driven
decision-making, and an emphasis on innovation. This blend has
been instrumental in their ability to lead MSI's expansion into bigbox retail and global sourcing e ectively.

integrity through vigilance and proactive investigative practices.
The company follows the principle of “Follow the Cash” to monitor
transactions and detect any irregularities. MSI takes swift action
when misconduct is suspected, including thorough investigations
and legal proceedings if necessary. To prevent issues, MSI
continually strengthens its internal controls with regular audits,
employee training, and transparent nancial reporting systems.
This vigilant approach ensures MSI upholds its ethical standards
and fosters a culture of accountability, protecting its assets and
reputation.

The Philosophy of "Follow the Cash"
Tracing Financial Flows
MSI operates under the mantra "Follow the Cash," a
guideline that becomes especially pertinent in industries
prone to cash-heavy transactions, such as remodeling and
contractor businesses. This approach involves close
monitoring of cash ows within the company, particularly
in areas like accounts receivable, employee expense
reports, and credit card usage.

MSI,
maintaining
nancial integrity and
transparency is
paramount. Given the
complex nature of global
trade and the diverse
markets MSI operates in,
the company is
particularly vigilant
about potential nancial
discrepancies. This
chapter explores MSI's proactive approach to investigative
practices, focusing on ensuring that every transaction and
business operation re ects the company’s strong ethical
standards.

Identifying Red Flags
Recognizing Signs of Financial Misconduct
The leadership at MSI is trained to recognize signs of
unusual activities that might indicate misconduct. These
include:
• Anomalies in Accounts Receivable: Unexpected
delays in payments or unusual patterns in customer
credits can be indicative of underlying issues. Sales Tax
Avoidance on non-existing account.
• Employee Expense Reports: Discrepancies or

Cultivating Team Unity:
Strategic Approaches to
Team Building at MSI
This chapter discusses Raj and Rup’s strategic expansion e orts
at MSI. Raj focused on expanding into big-box home improvement
retailers, while Rup strengthened MSI’s global sourcing networks.
Their leadership introduced innovations like digital porcelain tiles
and quartz surfaces, helping MSI secure a strong market position by
2020. The chapter highlights how MSI has stayed ahead of industry
trends and leveraged technolo y to grow its market share.

ff

407

n the journey of transforming MSI from a modest
startup into a global leader in the surfacing industry,
the development of cohesive and e ective teams has been
pivotal. Manu's approach to team building revolves around
creating a competitive yet supportive atmosphere, where
the notion of losing is not entertained, and each team
member is geared towards a collective victory. This chapter
delves into the strategic facets of fostering a robust team
culture that drives MSI’s continual growth and success.

The Game of Growth - Building a Competitive
Team Spirit
Manu believes in infusing elements of gami cation into
team activities, enhancing engagement and motivation
across the board. He views the business landscape as a
competitive game where having a clear set of goals and
tasks is crucial for victory. Each team member is assigned
speci c roles with clear accountability, embodied in the
concept of the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI). This
structure ensures that everyone knows their
responsibilities and how they contribute to the team's
objectives.

Strategic Opposition - Utilizing Competition to
Foster Unity
One of Manu’s unique strategies in team building is the
utilization of a real or imagined adversary. By de ning a
common enemy—sometimes a competing company,
sometimes a challenging project, and at times, even time

fi

fi

ff

fi

408

itself—Manu creates a unifying force within the team. The
presence of an "enemy" minimizes internal con icts and
focuses the team on the external challenge, driving them to
pool their strengths and work cooperatively.

Supporting the Underdog - Strengthening the
Weakest Link
A key tenet of Manu’s team-building philosophy is that "a
team is only as strong as its weakest member." To this end,
considerable resources and time are dedicated to training
and uplifting the team's less skilled members. This not only
enhances the overall competency of the team but also
fosters a culture of support and empathy, reinforcing the
idea that everyone’s growth contributes to the team’s
success.

Prioritization and Focus - Choosing Battles
Wisely
Manu advises that while it’s important to have high
aspirations, recognizing the team's limits is essential for
e ective strate y execution. Not all goals can be pursued
simultaneously without diluting the team's e orts. He
advocates for selecting strategic goals that align with the
company’s core mission while postponing or delegating
others. This selective focus ensures that the team does not
become overwhelmed and can achieve signi cant victories
one step at a time.

fl

ff

fi

g

ff

409

Recognition and Renewal - Celebrating Success
and Resetting Goals
After every project or challenge, Manu makes it a point to
celebrate the team's achievements, regardless of the
outcome. He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging
everyone’s e orts and then resetting the objectives for the
next challenge. This routine of recognition followed by
renewal keeps the team motivated and focused on
continuous improvement.

Building Teams of Teams - Expanding the
Team Building Model
As MSI grows, the concept of a 'team of teams' becomes
integral. This approach involves creating multiple
interlinked teams that operate with a degree of autonomy
yet are aligned towards the company’s overarching goals.
This structure supports scalability and adaptability,
enabling MSI to manage its expanding operations more
e ectively.

Conclusion: A Culture of Positive Team
Dynamics
These strategies have created a strong team culture at
MSI, de ned by positivity, mutual support, and a shared
commitment to the company's goals. Manu’s approach to
team building—emphasizing encouragement, strategic
focus, and continuous learning—has set up MSI’s foundation
and fostered a dynamic workplace where every team
member can thrive.

workplace for employees, one that re ects America's rich
tradition of diversity and inclusion. This chapter delves into
how Manu, along with Rika, nurtured an environment
where employees are valued as the company’s greatest

Employees as the Best Assets
Manu rmly believed
that employees are
the most valu able

balance sheets. "GAAP
doesn't know how to measure employees as assets," he
often remarked, highlighting a gap in traditional accounting
practices. Recognizing the pivotal role of employees in
MSI's success, Manu and Rika prioritized their well-being,
development, and satisfaction. From the outset, Manu was
unwavering in his commitment to creating the best possible
workplace for MSI employees while fostering and celebrating
America's rich tradition of diversity. He rmly believed that
employees are the most valuable assets a company can have,
even though this value isn't re ected on any balance sheet.

Championing Women's Rights and Flexibility
From the very beginning, Manu along with leadership of
Rika ensured that MSI upheld women's rights and provided
the necessary exibility in working hours - No Harassment
from Man’s world - this commitment stemmed from their
own experiences and understanding of the challenges faced
by women in balancing work and personal responsibilities.
They established policies that supported women in the
workplace, fostering an environment where everyone
could thrive.

Embracing Diversity and Fighting
Discrimination
As minorities themselves—by race, ethnicity, and religion
in both America and India—Manu and Rika were acutely
aware of the potential for discrimination. They made it a
point to create an inclusive workplace where diversity was
not only accepted but celebrated. This commitment to
diversity was re ected in MSI's hiring practices, workplace
policies, and corporate culture.

Recognition as a Top Workplace
Manu's vision for MSI included making it a top workplace
where employees would feel valued and motivated. As
early as 2001, when MSI exceeded 100 employees, the
company began competing for and winning accolades as a
top place to work. This tradition continued under Raj’s
leadership, who took over as head of HR, and further

fl

MSI’s dedication to creating a supportive and inclusive
workplace has been recognized through numerous awards
over the years. In 2023 and 2024, MSI received several
prestigious accolades, a rming its status as a top
workplace. These awards are a testament to the company’s
ongoing commitment to its employees and its e orts to
foster a diverse and inclusive environment.

strengthened MSI’s supply chain. Together, they introduced
innovations like digital porcelain tiles and expanded the company’s
quartz surface o erings, positioning MSI as a market leader by
2020.

he syner y between Manu and Rika’s sons, Raj and
Rup were palpable as they carved out their
respective domains within MSI. With a clear division of
responsibilities, they set out to invigorate the company with
fresh ideas and strategic expansions. Raj took the helm of
extending MSI's reach into big-box home improvement
centers, a sector that promised substantial growth and
visibility. Meanwhile, Rup focused on expanding MSI’s
network of imports and strengthening relationships with
overseas vendors.

Raj's Big-Box Strate y
Raj's approach was meticulous and driven by the
understanding that partnerships with big-box retailers
could transform MSI's market presence. He focused on
tailoring MSI's o erings to meet the demands of these large
retailers, ensuring that MSI's products not only met quality
and design standards but also aligned with the logistical
and operational frameworks of these retail giants. His
e orts were aimed at making MSI a household name
associated with quality, reliability, and innovation in home
improvement.

Rup's Global Sourcing Expansion
On the other side, Rup’s strate y involved deepening and
broadening MSI’s vendor networks across the globe. He
worked on securing diverse and reliable sources for raw
materials, ensuring that MSI could o er a wide range of
products that appealed to varied consumer tastes and

Embracing Digital Innovation in Porcelain
Tiles
Under the leadership of Raj and Rup, MSI also began to
explore new trends in the feel, touch, color, sizes, and
nishes of tiles. The advent of digital technolo y in the
production of porcelain tiles marked a signi cant
innovation. This technolo y allowed for the creation of tiles
that could mimic almost any look - be it wood, stone, or
even elaborate artistic patterns - with the added bene ts of
a maintenance-free porcelain surface and minimal grout
joints.

The Rise of Mosaic Tiles
The demand for decorative tiles, particularly mosaics,
saw a signi cant upsurge. Responding to this trend, MSI
expanded its o erings to include over a thousand designs,
colors, and patterns in mosaic tiles. This move not only
catered to the aesthetic and functional needs of customers
but also positioned MSI as a leader in tile design
innovation.

Leadership in Trends and Technolo y

to audit and improve supply chain processes.

visionary leadership and a sharp focus on industry trends
and technological advancements. The company wasn’t just
growing in size; it was becoming a respected trendsetter,
leading the way in innovation. Raj and Rup, with their
unique but complementary strategies, had steered MSI to
new heights, solidifying its position as a leader in the
market.
Then came 2010, a pivotal year for the industry. Quartz
surfaces, which replicated the look of granite but with a
man-made touch, began to rise in popularity. These slabs,
available in 3CM or 2CM thickness, started to address many
of the issues associated with natural stone. Made up of 92%
natural quartz and 8% resin, these factory-produced slabs
could mimic the appearance of granite or marble in just 48
hours—an extraordinary feat considering that mother
nature takes 30 million years to achieve the same result.
MSI saw the potential in this emerging market and
quickly entered the fray. They didn’t just stop at
introducing quartz slabs; they went a step further by
creating marble-like surfaces with superior properties,
particularly suited for kitchen use. This innovation became
a game changer. By 2020, MSI had captured over 15% of the
market, with an even larger share in the highly sought-after
white Carrara and Calacatta looks. MSI dominated this
segment from coast to coast in the USA, cementing its place
as a leader in the quartz surface market.

423

Conclusion: A Future Built on Innovation and
Insight
The combined e orts of Raj and Rup, underpinned by
their father Manu’s foundational work, ensured that MSI
was not just keeping pace with industry changes but often
staying one step ahead. Their proactive approach to
embracing new technologies, trends, and global markets
illustrated their commitment to MSI’s continued growth
and adaptation. As leaders, they continued to foster a
culture of innovation, quality, and customer-centricity,
ensuring that MSI’s legacy as a family-owned business
would thrive in the dynamic and competitive world of
global trade and home improvement.

big-box retail was a strategic move aligned with the evolution of
retail giants like Home Depot and Lowe’s. These stores
revolutionized the way consumers shopped for home improvement
products, o ering a vast array of choices under one roof. Raj's

ff

ff

ff

424

decision to focus on this sector mirrored a broader industry trend
where manufacturers needed to adapt to the growing dominance of
big-box chains, which were reshaping supply chains and consumer
expectations.
2. Globalization and Supply Chain Evolution: The late 20th
and early 21st centuries witnessed an unprecedented shift toward
globalization, with companies looking beyond their borders for
sourcing and manufacturing. Rup’s expansion of MSI’s global
sourcing re ected this larger trend of establishing e cient, coste ective, and reliable supply chains worldwide. This period marked
the rise of China, India, and other Asian countries as major players
in manufacturing, and MSI’s ability to tap into these markets
underscored its adaptability and forward-thinking approach.
3. Technological Advancements in Tile Manufacturing: The
digital revolution in porcelain tile production around the 2000s
allowed manufacturers to create intricate designs and patterns that
previously weren't possible. This innovation paralleled the larger
digital transformation happening in various industries. By
embracing digital technolo y, MSI positioned itself at the forefront
of this shift, capitalizing on consumer demand for high-quality,
aesthetically versatile tiles.
4. The Quartz Surface Boom (2010s): The popularity of quartz
surfaces surged as homeowners sought alternatives to natural stone
that o ered durability, ease of maintenance, and aesthetic appeal.
MSI's rapid entry into this market coincided with a broader
movement toward engineered surfaces in interior design,
demonstrating the company's agility in recognizing and responding
to emerging trends.
Cultural Context

journey embodies the American entrepreneurial spirit, where
second-generation leaders build upon their parents' foundation to

willingness to embrace innovation re ect the broader narrative of
immigrants and their descendants contributing to the economic
fabric of America through hard work, adaptability, and a relentless
pursuit of excellence.
2. Asian Family Business Values: Raj and Rup's collaboration is
rooted in traditional Asian values of family, loyalty, and collective
e ort. The concept of "dividing and conquering" is reminiscent of
how family businesses in Asian cultures often rely on each member
to take on speci c roles, ensuring the prosperity and longevity of the
enterprise. This cultural aspect underscores their ability to work
together seamlessly, leveraging their strengths to drive MSI's success.
3. Consumer Desire for Quality and Innovation: The surge in
demand for products like digital porcelain tiles and quartz surfaces
mirrors a broader cultural trend toward quality, customization,
and sustainability in home design. MSI's responsiveness to these
trends demonstrated an acute understanding of shifting consumer
preferences, which increasingly favored materials that combined
aesthetics with practicality.
4. Sustainability and Global Awareness: As MSI expanded its
global sourcing network, it was operating in a world increasingly
conscious of environmental sustainability and ethical business
practices. Rup's e orts to establish e cient and responsible sourcing
channels were not just about pro t but also about aligning with a
growing cultural emphasis on sustainable and ethically sourced
products.

Regrets in Life
This chapter explores the Shah family’s re ections on business
and personal regrets. While the Shahs have faced few regrets, the
chapter emphasizes the lessons learned from missteps with
suppliers, product lines, and di cult family relationships. Manu
shares how these experiences reinforced the importance of strategic
decision-making, surrounding oneself with positive in uences, and
learning from past mistakes.

427

The Lessons from Wrong Choices
Throughout their business
ventures, the Shahs have
occasionally found themselves
entangled with the wrong
suppliers, employee s, or
customers, and have even
pursued product lines that
proved unsustainable. These
missteps consumed time and
resources, forcing them to
reconsider and re ne their strategies. These moments of
misjudgment reinforced a crucial lesson: the value of
careful selection and strategic foresight in any business
endeavor.

The Struggle Against Negativity
For Manu, one of the most challenging aspects of his
journey has been dealing with the "no-sayers"—those who
seem to revel in negativity, constantly complaining or
nding fault. Over time, he realized the toll such negativity
takes, not just on morale, but on the very fabric of

that their path has been remarkably free of regrets,
at least compared to what others might have faced. Yet, the
few regrets they do harbor have shaped their lives in
profound ways, serving as lessons etched in their
memories.

progress. Surrounding himself with positive, constructive
individuals became a priority. Manu learned that nurturing
a positive environment is essential, both for personal wellbeing and for the sustained success of any venture.

Family Emotions
Emotional involvement within the family or extended
family presents complex challenges. There are no easy,
rational, or logical answers when emotions are at play. One
signi cant regret for Manu was the time spent with his
brother, who remained a lifelong gambler. Despite e orts to
help, this relationship consumed a considerable amount of
time and emotional ener y, with little positive outcome.

Lessons Learned

These experiences have reinforced several key lessons:
• The importance of making informed, strategic
decisions to avoid unsustainable paths.
• The need to surround oneself with positive in uences
and minimize exposure to negativity.
• The understanding that family dynamics can be
complex and emotionally taxing, often lacking clear
solutions.
• Acquiring another business in 1992 94 and 1998 2001
each was for quick growth, expanded services but
resulted in di culty changing core values of acquired
company and took proportionately more of Manu’s time

with unimpressive results! Moving forward, MSI made
very few acquisitions in the following 25 years and the
ones that were made had a very clear strategic value.
Through these re ections, Manu emphasizes the
importance of learning from regrets and using these
lessons to guide future actions, ensuring a more positive
and productive path forward.
Learning from regrets in business is a powerful tool for
improvement and growth. When we re ect on our regrets,
we can gain insights into where we went wrong and why.
This process allows us to identify the decisions and actions
that led to undesirable outcomes. By understanding our
past mistakes, we can make better decisions in the future,
avoid repeating the same errors, and improve our business
strategies.
Here are ways learning from regrets (“Failure is the Best
Coach”) can help improve business:
• Enhanced Decision-Making: Carefully considering what
we regret and why helps us to reverse course or make
better decisions moving forward.
• Cultivating a Learning Culture: Recognizing that failure
is inevitable in complex organizations, leaders can create
a culture where employees feel safe to admit or report
failures, leading to consistent reporting and deep analysis
of mistakes.
• Strategic Improvements: Regrets can signal that
improvement is possible. The key is to avoid obsessing

fl

fl

over them and instead extract lessons that can be applied
in future situations.
• Better Risk Management: Re ecting on past regrets can
improve our decision-making skills, especially in

Foundations of Growth:
Expanding MSI's Reach
This chapter chronicles MSI’s evolution from a small home-based
business to a global leader in natural stone and surfacing materials.
MSI capitalized on changing consumer preferences, forming key
partnerships with major retailers, and establishing a Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO) center in India. These moves fueled the
company’s expansion, while family values and a commitment to
quality remained central to its growth.

progressed,
Manu’s vision for MSI
continued to evolve,
re ecting not only
market demands but
also his personal
dedication to the
c o m p a n y ’s g r o w t h .
From 1984 to 1986, the
Shah family operated
MSI from their home in
Cerritos, California. This period was a time of balancing the
burgeoning demands of business with family life, as their
children high school. Recognizing the need for more space
and a more professional setup, MSI moved to a 5,400
square foot warehouse in Santa Fe Springs. This move
marked the beginning of a new chapter, setting the stage
for signi cant expansion.

Catering to Changing American Home
Preferences
During this time, American homeowners began to shift
their preferences from carpeted oors, which were
associated with allergies, to harder surface materials. This
change in consumer taste opened new opportunities for
MSI. The company began importing marble from Spain,
granite tiles, and trendy multicolored slates from India,
along with limestone from Turkey and Mexico. As carpets
in American homes declined from covering 82% of oors to

fl

fl

fi

fl

442

less than 50%, MSI positioned itself as a leader in supplying
all natural stone products for the home.

Mission: "Natural Stone in Every Home"
Manu’s mission, "Natural Stone in Every Home," evolved
into making natural stone a ordable and accessible to a
broader audience. This mission drove the company to
expand further, opening more locations across America,
including Edison, New Jersey; Dallas, Texas; and Atlanta,
Georgia. These strategic locations enabled MSI to distribute
a diverse range of products more e ciently across the
country.

Breakthrough with Major Retailers
A signi cant milestone was reached when MSI began
supplying products to divisions of Home Depot in the early
2000s, marking its entry into the retail space. This
partnership not only expanded MSI’s visibility but also
solidi ed its reputation as a reliable supplier of high-quality
natural stone products.

International Expansion and Employee
Growth
By 2002, the volume of MSI’s operations had grown
exponentially, with over 8,000 containers being imported
annually from around the world. This growth necessitated
not only a larger workforce but also a more coordinated
operational strate y. As a result, MSI expanded its
geographic reach and operational e ciency by starting a

ffi

g

fi

fi

443

Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) center in Bangalore,
India. This center supported various back-end operations,
allowing the U.S. branches to focus more on sales and
customer service.

Keeping Up with the Demand
The expansion into a BPO re ected Manu’s foresight in
leveraging global resources to streamline operations. As the
company grew to over 100 employees, the foundations laid
in the early days in the basement of their home continued
to guide MSI’s evolution. The company’s growth was not
just in size but also in the scope, embracing technological
and operational advancements to remain at the forefront of
the industry.

Re ections on Growth and Family
Throughout this period of rapid expansion, Manu and
Rika remained committed to their family values, which
were deeply embedded in the company's culture. This
commitment ensured that as MSI grew, it did not lose sight
of the principles that had guided it from its inception—
integrity, quality, and a vision to make natural stone an
accessible luxury for every American home.
MSI’s story illustrates how vision combined with
steadfast dedication can transform a modest family-run
business into a major player in the global market, changing
the landscape of home design in America and beyond.

Historical Context
1. Natural Stone Industry Growth (1980s-2000s): The late
20th century saw a shift in consumer preferences toward more
natural and sustainable materials for home design. MSI capitalized
on this trend by expanding its product o erings and entering the
retail market with partnerships like those with Home Depot. These
strategic moves allowed MSI to position itself as a leader in natural
stone products, coinciding with the broader market trend of
integrating sustainable materials into everyday home construction.
2. Globalization and Outsourcing (1990s-2000s): MSI’s
decision to establish a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) center in
Bangalore, India, in 2002 re ects the broader trend of global
companies leveraging international labor markets to streamline
operations. This was part of a wave of outsourcing in the late 1990s
and early 2000s, as companies sought to reduce costs and improve
e ciency by utilizing resources from emerging markets.
Cultural Context
1. Shifts in American Home Design Preferences: By the
1990s, American consumers were increasingly prioritizing hard
surfaces like stone and tile over carpeting, both for aesthetic reasons

durable home materials.

1. Understand Your Opponent's Forces
In chess, it's crucial to understand the position, potential
moves, and threats posed by your opponent's pieces. This
mirrors business, where competitors deploy resources,
such as purchasing power, inventory, and workforce to gain
an advantage. In leading MSI, Manu always took time to
analyze the competition's strengths and weaknesses—be it
their market position, attrition rate, or working hours—and
adjusted MSI’s strategies accordingly. Like a chess player,
he sought to stay ahead by anticipating the next move of
competitors and planning counterstrategies.

2. Play a Defensive Game to Tire Out Your Opponent
Patience is essential in chess, especially when playing
defensively. The game can often become a waiting match,
where you outlast your opponent's attempts to break
through your defenses. Manu applied this principle in
business, particularly when entering competitive markets
or when resources were tight. The key was not to expect
quick miracles but to play the long game, allowing
competitors to tire themselves out while conserving MSI’s
strength for a decisive moment. This defensive posture
enabled MSI to thrive during economic downturns and
crises when other companies faltered.
3. Do Not Attack Unless You Are Sure to Win
Chess teaches that launching an attack prematurely can
leave you exposed, leading to disastrous consequences.
Manu learned that in business, attacking competitors headon without a thorough understanding of the consequences
can back re. Whether expanding into new markets or
launching new products, Manu ensured that MSI’s moves
were calculated, and that victory was almost certain. He
was careful not to open any " anks" without adequate
preparation, knowing that a poorly timed initiative could
invite competitors to strike at his vulnerabilities.
4. Protect Your Queen & All Your Best Assets
In chess, the queen is your most valuable piece, and
losing it often means losing the game. For Manu, the queen
represented MSI’s senior leaders and top talent—those
indispensable assets who were key to the company’s

fl

fi

464

success. He understood the importance of protecting these
assets at all costs. Senior leadership at MSI was nurtured,
appreciated, and supported because Manu knew that the
loss of a key leader could lead to a cascade of negative
e ects throughout the organization. Retaining top talent
became a hallmark of MSI’s leadership philosophy.
Manu took this principle even further by instituting a nolayo policy at MSI, a commitment that re ects his deep
belief in the intrinsic value of his workforce. Unlike many
companies that might reduce sta during challenging
times, MSI has never laid o any employee due to a lack of
work. This approach not only preserves the company's
strength and morale but also fosters a culture of loyalty and
mutual respect, reinforcing the idea that employees are the
true "queens" of the organization—indispensable to its
success.

5. Think Before Every Move with a Clear Goal in
Mind
Chess is a game of foresight, where each move must be
carefully considered in the context of a larger goal. Manu
approached business with the same mindset. Before
making major decisions, he always considered the broader
implications and how each action would align with MSI's
long-term objectives. Whether it was entering a new
market, acquiring a new supplier, or expanding the product
line, Manu ensured that every move served a strategic
purpose. This clarity of vision kept MSI on a steady growth
trajectory for decades.

6. Adaptability Is Key
In chess, no game ever follows a strict pattern. Each
move by the opponent changes the dynamics of the game,
and successful players must adapt quickly. Similarly, Manu
understood that business was uid, and adaptability was
crucial to staying competitive. When new challenges arose—
whether technological advancements, supply chain
disruptions, or shifting consumer demands—Manu and MSI
adapted swiftly, recalibrating their strategies to ensure
continued success.
7. Sacri ce Wisely and Only When Necessary
Chess often requires calculated sacri ces to achieve a
winning position. In business, Manu understood that
sometimes short-term sacri ces were necessary for longterm gains. However, like in chess, sacri ces in business
should be made wisely and with a clear understanding of
the potential outcome. Manu made di cult decisions over
the years, such as good-bye to major customer(large
Distributors) or exiting certain markets ( Electronic Export
from USA, Monument business, Fabrication & Instolations)
or scaling back speci c product lines, but always with the
foresight that it would lead to greater success in the future.

Expanding the Chess Metaphor: Leaders as
Strategists, Not Just Players
Chess is often seen as a game reserved for intellectuals
and strategists. While being an excellent chess player can
certainly hone one's strategic thinking, the true genius of

fi

ffi

fi

fl

fi

fi

fi

466

chess lies not in mastery of the game itself, but in the
lessons it teaches about leadership and decision-making.
Many leaders, including Manu Shah, may not have been
world-class chess players, but they have excelled in
learning and applying the lessons of chess in their business
and personal lives. Chess, after all, is a game of
resourcefulness, planning, and adaptability—all qualities
essential to good leadership.
1. Knowing When to Use Each Piece: Leaders Are Like
Chess Pieces
In chess, every piece has a distinct role, and the success
of a player depends on knowing when and how to use each
piece e ectively. The queen, the most powerful piece on
the board, is your go-to for o ensive maneuvers, while
pawns, though often overlooked, can be used to open the
board and provide critical defense. Similarly, in business,
leaders must recognize the strengths and roles of their
team members, each of whom brings unique skills to the
table. Manu has always understood this concept, likening
di erent leadership roles in MSI to the various chess pieces.
• The Queen (Executive Leadership): Just as the
queen has the most versatility on the board, the
executive leadership at MSI has the most in uence.
Whether it's guiding the company toward new markets,
making key decisions, or driving innovation, these
leaders wield immense power and are central to the
company's success.
• The Rook (Operations Leadership): The rook moves
in straight lines, representing stability and structure. In

fl

ff

ff

ff

467

the same way, the operations leadership at MSI is
responsible for ensuring that everything runs smoothly,
from supply chain management to production. They are
the backbone of the company, providing order and
predictability.
• The Bishop (Product or Market Development): The
bishop moves diagonally, cutting across the board in
unique ways. This is akin to the product or market
development teams at MSI, who must think creatively
and nd angles others may miss. Their job is to keep the
company competitive and ahead of industry trends.
• The Knight (Sales and Marketing): The knight moves
in an "L" shape, jumping over other pieces and executing
unconventional moves. This represents the sales and
marketing teams at MSI, who often have to think outside
the box, nd innovative ways to reach customers, and
sometimes make bold moves to capture market share.
• The Pawn (Entry-Level Leaders and Employees):
Though pawns are the least powerful pieces, they are
critical in setting up the board and paving the way for
more strategic moves. In MSI, the entry-level employees,
often seen as pawns, are vital for executing day-to-day
tasks. Their work is essential for larger, strategic
initiatives, and, given the right conditions, they can be
promoted, just as a pawn can be promoted to a queen.
Understanding how and when to use these di erent
"pieces" has been critical to Manu’s leadership. Like a chess
player, Manu evaluates each situation to determine which
leaders and employees are best suited to tackle speci c

fi

ff

fi

fi

468

challenges. The goal is always to align their strengths with
the needs of the company, ensuring that each move is wellcalculated and contributes to MSI’s long-term strate y.
2. Applying Lessons Even When You’re Not Playing
While some leaders may not be the best at playing chess,
they excel at applying its principles in real-world situations.
Chess teaches that every move must be calculated, with
consequences considered long before they happen. It’s not
about being the best player, but about learning the lessons
that chess imparts and knowing how to use those lessons to
lead e ectively. For Manu, chess was never just a game—it
was a blueprint for leadership.
Manu learned that in both chess and business, it's
essential to stay calm under pressure and think several
moves ahead. The ability to foresee potential outcomes and
respond accordingly is what separates a good leader from a
great one. Similarly, the willingness to sacri ce lesser assets
for the sake of a larger goal—while ensuring that core values
and key leaders (your "queen") are protected—is a lesson
that Manu has applied time and again throughout his
career.
3. Adaptability and Leadership: No One Strate y Wins
All
One of the key lessons Manu took from chess was that no
single strate y works in every game. Each opponent is
di erent, and so is each business challenge. Just as a chess
player must constantly adjust their strate y based on the
moves of their opponent, leaders must be adaptable in

g

g

g

fi

g

ff

ff

469

their approach. Manu recognized early on that while some
business situations required aggressive tactics, others
demanded patience and restraint.
When entering new markets, for example, MSI didn't
rush in aggressively without understanding the landscape.
Instead, they often took a more measured, defensive
approach, analyzing the competition and gradually making
inroads while ensuring they had a solid base of operations.
This adaptability allowed MSI to grow steadily and avoid
costly mistakes that could have set them back.

Conclusion:
The Game of Life and Business
For Manu, the lessons from chess were not about
becoming the best player but about learning how to
approach challenges strategically. By understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of his team, adapting to new
situations, and playing the long game, Manu was able to
guide MSI to success. Chess taught him that leadership is
about more than just making moves—it's about making the
right moves, at the right time, with the right resources.

The Chessboard of Life
Manu's ability to apply chess strategies to business has
been a signi cant factor in MSI’s sustained success. The
game taught him to think ahead, protect his most valuable
assets, and only attack when victory was assured. Manu's
chess lessons continue to guide his leadership, teaching

fi

470

him the importance of patience, adaptability, and strategic
thinking. Just like on the chessboard, business is a constant
struggle to stay ahead of the competition, but with the right
moves, it can lead to triumph.
Quotes
Garry Kasparov: "Chess is life in miniature. Chess is
struggle, chess is battles."
Sun Tzu: "Strate y without tactics is the slowest route to
victory. Tactics without strate y is the noise before defeat."
Michael Porter: "The essence of strate y is choosing
what not to do."
Chanakya: "Before you start some work, always ask
yourself three questions – Why am I doing it, What the
results might be, and Will I be successful. Only when you
think deeply and nd satisfactory answers to these
questions, go ahead."
Historical Context
1. The Strategic Role of Chess in Leadership (Ancient to
Modern Times): Chess has long been recognized as a metaphor for
strate y, warfare, and leadership, dating back to its origins in
ancient India as Chaturanga. Throughout history, leaders like
Napoleon Bonaparte and Winston Churchill used chess to sharpen
their strategic thinking. Manu Shah’s application of chess principles
to his leadership at MSI mirrors this historical trend, demonstrating
how timeless strategies from chess can be applied to decisionmaking and navigating complex challenges in business.

2. The Evolution of Business Strate y (20th-21st Century):
As the business world grew more competitive and complex in the
20th and 21st centuries, the need for strategic planning, foresight,
and adaptability became more apparent. Manu's use of chess
principles, such as anticipating competitors' moves and adapting to
changing market dynamics, aligns with how successful businesses
have historically incorporated strategic thinking to gain an
advantage.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Cultural Emphasis on Strategic Thinking and
Wisdom: Chess, originating in ancient India, has deep cultural
roots in strategic thinking and wisdom. The game teaches lessons in
patience, foresight, and calculated risk-taking—qualities that are
highly valued in Indian culture. Manu’s ability to apply these
principles to his leadership at MSI re ects this cultural heritage,
demonstrating how Indian values of strate y and long-term
planning have informed his approach to business.
2. The American Spirit of Competition and Adaptability:
American business culture celebrates competition, adaptability, and
the willingness to take calculated risks. Manu’s application of chess
lessons to business decisions, where he carefully planned each move
with a clear goal, mirrors this cultural emphasis on being proactive,
competitive, and adaptable in pursuit of success.
Business Context
1. The Importance of Strategic Planning in Business
Leadership: In the modern business environment, strategic
planning is essential for navigating market challenges, seizing
opportunities, and sustaining growth. Manu Shah’s approach to
business—where every decision was calculated, and every move was
made with a clear goal in mind—highlights the importance of
strategic planning in building and maintaining a competitive edge
in the industry.

2. The Role of Adaptability and Patience in Business
Growth: Just as in chess, where adaptability and patience are
crucial for success, MSI's growth has been marked by Manu's ability
to adapt to changing market conditions, technological
advancements, and competitive pressures. This adaptability allowed
MSI to make informed decisions, avoid premature actions, and
capitalize on opportunities when they arose.

Scalability, Measurability,
and Transparency
This chapter outlines how MSI's success is driven by three core
pillars: scalability, measurability, and transparency. By scaling
operations to meet mass-market demand, utilizing measurable data
to improve processes, and maintaining transparency to build trust,
MSI optimized growth, reduced risks, and enhanced e ciency.
These foundational principles have enabled the company to thrive
in a competitive market and maintain long-term success.

ffi

474

Scalability: Building for Mass Markets
Scalability has always been a
core tenet of MSI's strate y.
Manu's belief was simple:
nd a product that can scale
in terms of production and
distribution. It was crucial
that any new market niche
MSI entered had the potential
for mass-market appeal.
MSI sought out products that
could reach a broad customer
base and that o ered solutions for real, emerging trends in
consumer behavior.
One such example is MSI's early focus on hard surfaces
like granite and quartz countertops, which became a
dominant choice for home remodeling and new home
construction in the early 2000s. The trend away from
ceramic and Formica countertops was clear, and MSI
positioned itself to be a major supplier as kitchens became

g

ff

ff

475
fi

fi

or MSI, Scalability, Measurability, and Transparency
have been the guiding principles that enabled its
signi cant and sustained growth over the years. From the
outset, Manu envisioned MSI as a company that could
scale, penetrating large markets geographically across
North America, and becoming a leader in its niche. With
each market trend, MSI adapted, ensuring its products
were a ordable, accessible, and aligned with long-term
consumer demand.

the heart of American
homes. Scalability also
meant moving beyond
smaller markets like
monuments
(a
standalone sector
wherein its annual
re ve nu e a s o n d a t e
s t a n d s b e l o w M S I ’s
monthly revenue) into
broader opportunities
that could grow

exponentially.

Historical Context
MSI’s ability to scale was re ected in its shift from niche
granite sales to broader products like Luxury Vinyl Tiles
(LVT) and Porcelain, which became more than just a trend
—they were long-term staples in the ooring and surface
industry.

Measurabilit y: The Key to Continuous
Improvement
MSI’s operational philosophy can be boiled down to one
essential mantra: “You can’t improve what you can’t
measure.” Every aspect of MSI’s operations is tracked,
analyzed, and optimized based on measurable data.
W h e t h e r i t ' s a c c o u n t i n g , a c c o u n t re c e iv a b l e
performance, inventory management, or sales by
region, everything is measurable at MSI.

fl

fl

476

The importance of measurability spans across all
departments. For example, MSI meticulously measures Per
Person Purchasing (PPP) by zip code, metro area, and
region, providing valuable insights into where the
company should focus its marketing and Sales e orts or
establish new branches. In logistics, measuring delivery
times, eet performance, and distance from each
warehouse helps optimize e ciency, reduce costs, and
improve customer satisfaction.
By quantifying all
operations, MSI can
identify patterns, highlight
areas of improvement, and
maintain high standards of

example, are seen as a
problem, How to minimize
this problem, yet see it as
an opportunity to evaluate
why it happened and how
to adjust selling prices particularly to Big Box retailers
while minimizing them. Measurability is a cornerstone of
MSI’s continuous improvement.

Transparency: Building Trust Through
Honesty
For a company as global and multifaceted as MSI,
Transparency is essential to maintaining smooth

ff

ffi

fl

477

operations and building trust across the supply chain, sales
teams, customers, and employees.
Transparency fosters accountability and helps MSI
anticipate and mitigate potential risks. For MSI,
transparency means:
•
Suppliers provide honest and timely updates about
production status, local challenges, or shipment delays.
MSI sources from over 35 countries, making it vital to have
clear lines of communication and trust.
•
Sales teams provide accurate updates on customer
interactions, whether it’s securing a new builder account or
losing a customer.
•
Customers deserve clarity on product availability,
pricing, and delivery schedules.
•
Employees, who can openly communicate any
personal situations (like health issues or family matters)
that may a ect their performance, allowing MSI to be
proactive and supportive.

Transparency vs. Privacy/Con dentiality:
It's essential to emphasize that transparency, while a
vital principle for organizational growth, often comes into
tension with privacy and con dentiality. This complexity
can be especially challenging when considering sensitive
issues like employee privacy and con dential business
matters.

fi

fi

fi

ff

478

Transparency is highly valued in a business environment,
but it must be balanced with the privacy of employees. For
instance, an employee who is going through a personal
matter, such as a divorce or pregnancy, should have the
right to disclose that information only when they feel
ready. It's critical that companies respect these boundaries
and protect the personal lives of their employees.
Similarly, con dentiality in business—particularly
around sensitive information like pay structures, salary
raises, or bonus amounts—must take precedence. This
ensures that internal nancial information is handled
delicately and only shared when necessary to maintain
trust and professionalism within the company.
Ultimately, the guiding principle for managing these
complexities is the "Need to Know" basis. Leaders and
employees should only have access to information if it's
critical for decision-making or directly impacts their work.
This balance allows companies like MSI to maintain
transparency while safeguarding personal and con dential
information, ensuring the company operates with integrity
and respect for all.
By evaluating the need to know in every case, MSI can
continue to foster an open and transparent work culture
without compromising the privacy and con dentiality that
are equally crucial for long-term success.
It's also crucial to recognize that con dentiality and
privacy extend beyond the workplace and into our
personal lives. In today's digital age, personal privacy is
more important than ever, and it touches every aspect of

fi

fi

fi

fi

fi

479

our interactions, including with family members, friends,
and acquaintances.
Just as we carefully protect business information, we
must also respect the con dentiality of personal details.
For instance, something as simple as disclosing
someone’s mobile phone number or sharing details
about their personal life, like where they live, what car
they’re planning to buy, or even their health problems,
should never be done without explicit permission. Each
individual should have the autonomy to decide who has
access to their personal information, including mobile
devices, phone numbers, and even their thoughts on
sensitive matters like career changes or medical conditions.
In an era where personal boundaries are critical, the
principle of "Need to Know" should also apply to personal
life. Respecting the privacy and con dentiality of others in
their personal and professional lives re ects a deeper
understanding of mutual respect and integrity. It's
essential that these values be upheld both within and
outside the business environment to maintain trust and
harmony in relationships.

Historical Context:
Transparency in business can be traced back to the
aftermath of nancial scandals like Enron, where hidden
data and misleading nancial reports led to a collapse.
MSI’s commitment to transparency is rooted in the
understanding that businesses thrive when they operate
openly, fostering trust with their stakeholders.

The Syner y of Scalability, Measurability, and
Transparency
At the core of MSI’s success lies the syner y between
scalability, measurability, and transparency. A scalable
business model allows the company to grow into mass
markets. Measurability ensures that the company can
continuously improve and re ne its processes. And
transparency builds trust, not only with external
stakeholders like suppliers and customers but also
internally with employees and leadership.
The combination of these principles has allowed MSI to
thrive through market changes, economic shifts, and
geopolitical challenges, ensuring its position as an industry
leader.

Conclusion
As MSI continues to evolve, these three principles remain
integral to the company’s ongoing strate y, driving growth,
fostering innovation, and ensuring operational excellence
across every level of the business.

Peer-to-Peer Learning at
MSI
This chapter highlights how MSI fosters a culture of peer-to-peer
learning to encourage knowledge sharing, collaboration, and
leadership development. By leveraging the collective expertise of its
employees, MSI promotes continuous learning, strengthens
teamwork, and enhances problem-solving capabilities. Supported
by transparency and data sharing, peer learning is a key
component of MSI’s growth strate y, ensuring ongoing innovation
and adaptability.

g

485

eer-to-peer learning
is a powerful and
innovative strate y that
MSI has embraced to foster
collaboration, enhance
knowledge-sharing, and
develop leadership skills
across the company. This
approach leverages the
collective knowledge of
employees to solve
problems, share best practices, and drive company-wide
growth. Instead of relying solely on formal training
programs, MSI encourages employees to learn from each
other, providing a dynamic and engaging environment
where everyone can contribute to the learning process.
At MSI, peer-to-peer learning is seen to promote a
collaborative culture that not only increases connectivity
among employees but also solidi es individual expertise.
By pairing new hires with experienced peers and
encouraging ongoing learning sessions such as peer lunchand-learns, MSI creates opportunities for employees to
engage in continuous development. This not only helps in
building technical skills but also boosts con dence and
adaptability, which are critical in a fast-paced business
environment.

g

486

Bene ts of Peer-to-Peer Learning
1. Enhanced Connectivity and Teamwork: MSI
encourages employees to engage with peers across
di erent teams and departments, helping to create a
network of knowledge-sharing that breaks down silos.
2. Leadership Development: Peer learning helps in
identifying emerging leaders within the team, allowing
employees to take ownership of their development and that
of their peers.
3. Cost-E ective Training: By leveraging internal
expertise, MSI can o er high-quality training at a fraction of
the cost of traditional external programs. This approach
ensures that training is relevant and directly applicable to
real-world situations.
4. Increased Employee Engagement: Employees feel
more engaged and empowered when they are actively
involved in both teaching and learning, leading to a more
motivated and productive workforce.

Implementation of Peer-to-Peer Learning at
MSI
MSI has integrated peer-to-peer learning into its daily
operations through various strategies. From assigning peer
mentors during onboarding to organizing branch visits by
area experts and ongoing feedback sessions, the company
has built a system that encourages continuous

ff

ff

fi

ff

487

improvement and personal growth. For instance, during
sales meetings, employees are encouraged to discuss best
practices and share insights on common challenges,
allowing them to learn from each other's experiences and
build stronger teams.
The MSI University platform further strengthens this
initiative by o ering a variety of resources and training
modules, where employees can access relevant content and
engage in peer discussions on important topics. The peerto-peer learning environment extends beyond technical
skills, with a strong focus on leadership development and
problem-solving, making it an integral part of MSI’s overall
growth strate y.
By fostering a culture of peer learning, MSI not only
improves knowledge retention but also nurtures a sense of
ownership among employees, creating a thriving
environment where everyone is empowered to contribute
to the company's success.

Why Transparency is Important for Peer-toPeer Learning
Transparency plays a crucial role in fostering e ective
peer-to-peer learning. When information is openly shared
across teams and individuals, it enables employees to
understand the bigger picture, make informed decisions,
and learn from the successes and challenges of others. At
MSI, transparency ensures that every team member has
access to critical data, insights, and performance metrics,

ff

ff

g

488

fi

which in turn promotes a culture of continuous learning
and improvement.
1. Building Trust and Collaboration: Transparency is
essential for creating an environment of trust. When
leaders openly share performance metrics, challenges, and
strategies, it encourages employees to engage in honest
discussions about what works and what doesn’t. This
openness enables peers to feel comfortable sharing their
own experiences and insights, leading to more meaningful
knowledge exchanges.
2. Providing Actionable Insights: When team
members have access to transparent data, such as sales
gures, customer feedback, and project performance, they
can learn from each other’s experiences. This visibility
allows employees to compare results, identify areas for
improvement, and implement strategies that have proven
successful in other teams. Transparency helps make
learning actionable by connecting theory with real-world
examples.
3. Encouraging Accountability: Transparency in peerto-peer learning also promotes accountability. When
employees are aware that their performance metrics are
visible to others, it motivates them to take responsibility for
their actions and strive for improvement. This openness
fosters a culture of accountability, where employees not
only learn from their peers but are also motivated to
contribute to the collective success of the organization.
4. Facilitating Rapid Problem Solving: By having
access to a broad range of information, employees can
489

quickly identify best practices and solutions to common
challenges. Transparency allows peers to leverage each
other's expertise, reducing the time spent on trial and
error. This accelerates learning and enhances the e ciency
of problem-solving across the organization.
In conclusion, transparency is a cornerstone of e ective
peer-to-peer learning. It creates an environment where
knowledge is shared freely, trust is built, and accountability
is fostered. At MSI, transparency ensures that peer learning
is not only encouraged but actively contributes to the
company’s ongoing success and innovation.

Lifelong Learning: A Continuous Journey
Learning is not con ned to early education or job
training; it is a lifelong process. From the foundational
years of learning from parents between ages 1 6 and
teachers from ages 6 12, learning shifts when individuals
enter their teenage years. During this phase, peer-to-peer
learning becomes a crucial part of life lessons. Teenagers
absorb knowledge from their peers, both formally and
informally, which continues to some extent during college
and early job experiences.
In a growing company like MSI, this natural tendency

504

hen IBM introduced the personal computer to
the world 41 years ago, it was clear that this
technolo y would profoundly impact how we work and
live. However, the real question was how the world would
use this new technolo y to implement innovative ideas. We
quickly recognized the IBM PC’s potential.

Within a few months of its debut in
August 1981, we decided to acquire
a few PCs at MSI. Our goal was
simple: to understand the
technolo y and use it to our
business’s advantage. We have
always been a company that is
driven by a mission to leverage

g

g

g

505

technolo y for process innovation. And the IBM PC was a
signi cant step in that direction.
Installing the IBM PC at MSI revolutionized our work in
many ways. One of the most signi cant changes we saw was
how we recorded and maintained our inventory. We started
using electronic spreadsheets, which were much more
customizable, easy to maintain, collaborative, and
convenient for analyzing data than the traditional papercalculator duo. This was especially helpful in making quick
yet accurate decisions. As the number of our SKUs soon
exceeded the capacity of what a paper-calculator duo could
handle, electronic spreadsheets became essential. They
also made it easier for us to better control our pipeline
inventory and sales forecasts. The IBM PC made our
internal operations more e cient, and we could make
better decisions, allowing us to grow our business faster.
We use creative ways to use lower ends of technolo y –

medical, engineering, and other such applications. They
were prohibitively expensive and extremely complex to
operate. The advent of the IBM PC dramatically changed
that by making computing power much cheaper and
accessible to all. IT also decentralized the risk of failure.
This way, if one system went down, we could easily move
to the other without hindering our work progress.
MSI has a long-standing history of being an early adopter
of technolo y. The company’s culture of adaptability has
been instrumental in driving innovation in the industry. For
us, being an early adopter is not limited to technolo y, but

stone for building monuments. The nature of the business
required the company to deal with a wide range of designs
for these monuments, which often resulted in a lengthy and
time-consuming process. Traditionally, dealers would draw
a design on a piece of paper and send it to the
manufacturer by postal mail, which would take about a
week to reach and then another week to receive a reply.
But when Manu came across the fax machine, he
immediately
realized this
technolo y’s
potential to
shrink the
time lag and
revolutionize
how
the
company

communicated. These fax machines became an important
step in making the process of dealing with monument
designs much more e cient and streamlined.
Re ecting on this, MSI decided not only to invest in fax
machines for ourselves but also to purchase them in bulk
for our main customers and even sent a few out to our
suppliers in India. This strategic decision, inspired by the
thought that “a value is like a fax machine: it’s not much
use if you’re the only one who has one” (Kwame Anthony
Appiah), improved communication and e ciency within

ffi

ffi

fl

512

MSI and our trading partners, leading to a more productive
and successful business.
It added a lot of e ciency to our entire business cycle.
Now we would receive a fax for the order, and within no
time, we could send it further to the manufacturers in
India. A quote was received from them overnight, and we
could nalize the quote with our dealers the next day. The
business cycle, which took about two weeks, was
completed within two days. This improved communication
and e ciency allowed us to make faster and more accurate
decisions, resulting in increased productivity and
pro tability for the company.
Fax machines made sending and receiving documents
more e cient and provided an alternative to postal mail or
other delivery services. With fax machines, we could easily
handle items that required a signature, such as legal
documents or purchase orders. Additionally, sending or
receiving information about a project, product, or service
gave the recipient or us a printed copy of important data,
which was much more convenient than relying solely on
verbal communication.
Furthermore, MSI used fax broadcasting as a marketing
tool to drive sales by sending promotional materials and
product information to many recipients simultaneously. In
this way, fax machines improved communication and
operations and helped us reach more customers and grow
the business.
We have always been focused on nding innovative
solutions to business challenges at MSI. The fax and

operations, and reach more customers. MSI has continued
this e ort of reducing the communication lag since the
1980s till today when we use technologies like EDI, email,
and vendor and customer portals to exchange data and
documents.

Mobile Technolo y
This chapter explores MSI's pioneering journey in adopting
mobile technolo y from the early 1990s to the present,
demonstrating how this strategic move empowered the company to
stay ahead in a competitive global market. Starting with the heavy,
boxed cell phones of the early 90s—devices with limited battery life
and a high cost per minute—MSI's leadership recognized the
essential role of communication in business success.

n the early
1990s, MSI stood
at the forefront of
adopting mobile
t e c h n o l o y,
understanding that
communication was
the lifeblood of a
growing, global
business. The
company's journey
began with the use of
a boxed cell phone, a heavy device weighing over 5 lbs with
a mere 60-minute battery life and outdoor-only usage at a
steep cost of $1 per minute. While cumbersome by today’s
standards, this innovation represented MSI’s commitment
to staying connected and agile, even in its early stages. The
leadership team knew that adopting cutting-edge tools,
however rudimentary, would set MSI apart in the fastpaced world of distribution and supply chain management.
By 1992, technolo y had improved, and MSI transitioned
more portable devices, notably Nokia’s rst portable
cellphone supported by 2G networks. This marked a
turning point for MSI, making communication more
accessible for eld teams and leadership. Soon after,
Motorola’s ip phone and BlackBerry’s ip phone became
popular within the business community, and MSI was quick
t o a d o p t t h e m . T h e B l a c k B e r r y, i n p a r t i c u l a r,
revolutionized how business was conducted, allowing
employees to send Emails, manage appointments, and stay
productive while on the move. These devices provided MSI

with a competitive edge by fostering real-time
communication and decision-making, which became
essential as the company expanded its reach across
multiple continents.
The introduction of 3G networks in 2001 propelled MSI’s
operations to the next level. No longer just a phone, mobile
devices became essential business tools, enabling faster
data transmission and enhanced mobile applications. MSI
employees could now manage everything from inventory
systems to customer communications in the palm of their
hands. This technological leap signi cantly improved
operational e ciency and allowed MSI to better serve its
clients and partners worldwide.
The game-changer came with Apple’s introduction of the
iPhone. The arrival of smartphones at MSI multiplied the
company’s mobile usage tenfold. iPhones integrated
advanced software, apps, and user-friendly interfaces,
making them indispensable for day-to-day operations.
From real-time data analytics to managing logistics, MSI
fully embraced this revolution. With smartphones, MSI was
not only keeping pace with technolo y but also driving
innovation by improving communication, e ciency, and
productivity across the board. As technolo y continued to
evolve, so did MSI’s use of mobile tools, setting the stage for
a tech-enabled future.

Historical Context: The Rise of Mobile Technolo y in Business
The use of mobile phones in business began as a luxury, only
a ordable and practical for select industries. Early mobile phones,
like the one used at MSI in 1990, were primarily for emergency
communication. However, by the mid-1990s, as companies like
Nokia and Motorola introduced portable, more a ordable phones,
the business world began to recognize the untapped potential of
mobile communication. These innovations laid the foundation for
what would become an essential part of global commerce. By the
2000s, 3G networks revolutionized how data was transferred over
mobile devices, and the introduction of smartphones by Apple in
2007 fundamentally changed how businesses operated, including
MSI. The leap from a simple communication device to a
multifunctional business tool marked the beginning of a new era in
enterprise technolo y.
Technological Context: From Limited to Limitless
Communication
The early mobile devices had severe limitations in terms of
battery life, call time, and functionality. But as technolo y
advanced, mobile phones evolved into powerful business tools. 2G
networks allowed for the advent of text messaging and limited data
capabilities, which were enhanced by the 3G networks that followed.
The real breakthrough came with smartphones, particularly the
iPhone, which combined communication with computing power.
This convergence of technolo y allowed businesses to access a suite
of applications, ranging from email to full-scale enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems, all from the convenience of a mobile device.
At MSI, this meant more agile decision-making, enhanced customer
service, and improved operational e ciency, making mobile
technolo y an integral part of the company's strate y.

Conclusion
As of 2024, there are over 7.21 billion smartphones in use
worldwide, which constitutes around 60.42% of the global
population owning a smartphone. This is a signi cant
increase from earlier years, showing how essential
smartphones have become for personal and business use.
Furthermore, including both smart and feature phones, the
total number of mobile phone connections globally has
surpassed 8.31 billion. This number re ects the rapid
growth and penetration of mobile technolo y, driven by
the increasing demand for connectivity, especially with the
rise of 3G and 4G networks, and now the proliferation of 5G
networks.
By 2025, it is projected that 72% of all internet users will
access the web primarily through smartphones,
underscoring the dominant role these devices play in
communication and daily tasks.

The Email Revolution T r a n s f o r m i n g
Communication and
E ciency at MSI
This chapter highlights how MSI’s transition to email
communication in the early 1990s signi cantly reduced printing
and postage costs while enhancing communication speed. Email
revolutionized interactions with customers, suppliers, and internal
teams, becoming a strategic tool for improving operational
e ciency. This shift not only saved costs but also positioned MSI for
future technological advancements, reinforcing the company's
commitment to innovation.

n the early 1990s, the
business world began
experiencing a signi cant
shift with the advent of email
and
electronic
communication. This
transformation was not just
about faster communication
but also about changing how
companies conducted their
operations. Manu, with his
visionary approach, recognized the potential of this new
technolo y early on and strategically guided MSI to
leverage it for greater e ciency and cost savings. This
chapter explores how MSI embraced email communication
to revolutionize its interactions with customers, suppliers,
employees, and other stakeholders.

The Email Revolution: Instant Communication
and Action
With the introduction of email, MSI saw an immediate
improvement in the speed and e ciency of
communication. Unlike traditional mail, which could take
days or even weeks to reach its recipient, emails allowed
for instant delivery and immediate action. This instant
communication was particularly bene cial in:
• Customer Interactions: Prompt responses to customer
inquiries and faster resolution of issues plus Digital
invoices, Statements, Orders and payments receipts.

• Employee Communication: Streamlined internal
communication, and direct deposit of checks to their
bank accounts enabling quicker decision or action
making processes.
• Sales and Marketing: Rapid dissemination of marketing
materials and promotional o ers including Digital
Catalogs.
Signi cant Cost Reductions
One of the most notable impacts of adopting email
communication was the signi cant reduction in costs
associated with printing and postage. Manu estimated that
a single printed paper, costing about 4 cents, incurred
additional expenses of 2 cents for printing and nearly 40
cents in labor for handling, ling, and mailing. By moving
to email, MSI was able to drastically cut these costs. Some
key areas where cost savings were realized include:
• Reduction in Postage Expenses: In 1997, MSI’s postage
expenses were $9,000. Despite the company's
exponential growth over the next 25 years, these
expenses remained nearly the same, thanks to the switch
to electronic communication.

• Savings on Printing and Paper: The transition to email
reduced the need for printing, resulting in signi cant
savings on paper and printing supplies.
• Labor Cost Savings: The time and labor involved in
handling printed materials were greatly minimized,
freeing up employees to focus on more value-added
tasks.
Developing Clear Guidelines and Follow-Through
The successful implementation of email communication at
MSI required clear guidelines and consistent followthrough. Manu led the development of these guidelines,
which included:
• Email Etiquette: Establishing standards for professional
communication, including clarity, conciseness, and
timely responses.
• Data Management: Ensuring that emails were properly
archived and easily retrievable, enhancing e ciency in
information management.
• Security Protocols: Implementing measures to protect
Sensitive information and prevent data breaches.
• Training Programs: Conducting training sessions to
familiarize employees with the new system and its
bene ts.

Long-Term Impact: Sustaining E ciency and Growth
The shift to email communication was more than just a
technological upgrade for MSI; it was a strategic move that
supported the company ’s long-term grow th. By
maintaining nearly constant postage expenses while
growing 200 times in size, MSI demonstrated the powerful
impact of embracing digital communication. This move
also positioned MSI as a forward-thinking company, ready
to adapt to technological advancements and leverage them
for continuous improvement.
Conclusion: A Strategic Move Towards a Digital Future
Manu’s foresight in adopting email communication in the
early 1990s paved the way for MSI’s sustained e ciency
and growth. The move not only resulted in substantial cost
savings but also enhanced the company’s operational
agility. As MSI continues to evolve, the lessons learned from
this digital transformation remain a cornerstone of its
innovative approach to business.
This chapter highlights the importance of staying ahead of
technological trends and the bene ts of proactive
adaptation in achieving long-term success. Nearly all
businesses that survived are doing it but early adapters like
MSI enjoyed better growth.

T h e M S I Wa r e h o u s e /
Showroom Concept
This chapter explains how MSI revolutionized the retail industry
in 1996 by introducing warehouse showrooms, blending the
functionality of a retail showroom with the convenience of a
warehouse. This model allowed customers to directly interact with
products in a practical and cost-e ective setting, enhancing the
overall shopping experience. Today, MSI’s network of warehouse
showrooms continues to o er a unique, e cient approach to retail
while maintaining customer satisfaction and operational e ciency.

ffi

ffi

ff

540

n 1996, MSI revolutionized the retail industry by
introducing the concept of a showroom attached to a
warehouse. Our rst showroom, spanning 3000 sq feet,
was located within one of our warehouses at Allec Street,
Anaheim, and was the rst of its kind in the industry. The
idea behind the warehouse showroom was to provide a

unique customer experience by allowing customers to see,
touch, and feel our products before making a purchase. At
MSI, we have always believed in nding innovative
solutions to meet the needs of our customers, and the
warehouse showroom concept was no exception.
Being primarily a part of the wholesale business, we
understood the challenges that came with it. Most of our
competitors had warehouses attached to retail locations on

fi

fi

fi

541

main streets, which, although consumer-friendly, came
with a high cost of rent. We made a thoughtful decision to
locate our warehouses on side streets, which allowed us to
save on rent costs. However, we knew that to stand out and
attract customers; we needed to think of something unique.
That’s where the idea of attaching showrooms to our
warehouses came into play. By doing so, we were able to
o er customers the best of both worlds: the convenience of
browsing and purchasing products at the warehouse and
the experience of a traditional retail showroom.
The bene ts of having warehouse showrooms were
multiple. The larger space allowed us to showcase a greater
variety of products, giving customers a wider range of
options to choose from. Additionally, our contractors and
fabricators could see and feel the products in person,
which helped them make more informed decisions
regarding their own projects. But perhaps most
importantly, our entire space was designed with our
customers in mind. From the layout to the lighting, every
aspect was crafted to create a comfortable and enjoyable
shopping experience. By putting our customers rst, we
created a unique and successful retail experience in a
wholesale environment that set us apart from our
competitors.
Our approach to retail is unique, as we focus on curating
an experience for the customers of our customers. While
we stopped dealing directly with homeowners in 2010, we
continued to build relationships with contractors and earn
their trust and con dence. This trust translates into them
recommending our showrooms as the go-to destination for
their customers. By doing so, we create a seamless

fi

fi

ff

experience for the end customer, who can browse our
products in a curated, aesthetically pleasing environment.

Pictures from MSI's rst showroom on the Allec Street
MSI’s showrooms provide the best and most direct way to
connect with the end-users of our products. Contractors,

products in their homes when they visit our showrooms.
The design of our showrooms aims to help our customers
visualize every aspect of their space with ease. The
environment of our showrooms is both aesthetically
pleasing and practical. We have earned the trust and
con dence of industry professionals and homeowners ,

Historical Context
1. Evolution of Retail Concepts (1990s): In the 1990s, the
retail industry saw a shift towards more experiential shopping
environments. The concept of showrooming—allowing customers to
see, touch, and interact with products—gained popularity. MSI’s
introduction of warehouse showrooms in 1996 was innovative,
blending the cost-saving advantages of warehouse locations with the
experiential bene ts of retail showrooms. This model helped MSI
attract both wholesale and retail customers while keeping costs
lower than competitors who located in prime retail areas.
2. Rise of the Big-Box Model: During the late 1990s, big-box
stores like Home Depot and Costco were gaining prominence by
o ering large warehouse-style retail spaces. MSI’s warehouse
showroom model paralleled this trend by providing customers with
a wide range of products in a cost-e ective setting, appealing to both
contractors and homeowners.
Cultural Context
1. Customer-Centric Innovation: MSI’s decision to combine
showrooms with warehouses re ects a broader cultural shift
towards customer-centric innovation. By focusing on the needs of
contractors and end-users, MSI was able to create a unique
shopping experience that catered to the professional and consumer
markets, setting it apart from more traditional wholesale
businesses.
2. Visual Merchandising and Design Aesthetics: MSI’s
showrooms were designed with attention to detail, from lighting to
layout, allowing customers to visualize products in their own
homes. This emphasis on aesthetics and practicality re ects the
growing importance of design and experience in retail during the
1990s, a trend that continues to in uence showroom concepts today.

Pioneering Productivity:
Strategic Leap with Dual
Screens
This chapter explains how MSI's universal adoption of dualscreen setups in 2002 boosted productivity by 7 10%, enhancing
multitasking, reducing errors, and improving communication
across its o ces. By implementing this innovative practice, MSI
signi cantly increased operational e ciency, positioning itself as a
leader in workplace innovation and setting a new standard for

t MSI, we believe in pushing the boundaries of
innovation to fuel our growth and enhance our
operational e ciency. A testament to this core philosophy
is our historic decision in 2002 to adopt dual-screen setups
across the entire company—a pioneering move that not only
signi cantly boosted our productivity but also set industry
standards.

A Historic Decision
In the early 2000s, dual monitors were more of a novelty
than a necessity in corporate environments. Recognizing
the potential to drastically improve employee e ciency,
Manu made a strategic decision to equip every workstation
with dual screens. This bold move made us the rst in the
industry to adopt such a setup universally, marking a
signi cant milestone in our journey of innovation.

ffi

fi

ffi

fi

fi

550

The results were immediate and profound. By integrating
dual screens, we saw a productivity increase of 7 10%
across the company. This enhancement in productivity has
been a key factor in our ability to expand and scale our
operations more e ectively than ever before without
having to proportionately increase our team sizes.

The Bene ts of Dual Screens:
• Increased Productivity: The additional screen real
estate allows us to handle multiple tasks simultaneously
with ease, signi cantly cutting down on the time
required to toggle between applications and increasing
the throughput of work processed.
• Enhanced Multitasking: Dual screens facilitate an
environment where critical information can be displayed
continuously, aiding in faster decision-making and more
uid work ows—essential components in elds that
demand high levels of accuracy and speed.
• Optimized Workspace: A dual-monitor setup helps
maintain a cleaner and more organized digital
workspace. This organization is crucial for reducing
cognitive load and focusing more on the tasks at hand.
• Reduced Errors and Improved Accuracy: With data
and applications spread across two monitors, we are less
likely to make errors due to misreading information or
losing track of tasks. This setup particularly bene ts roles

• Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:
Keeping communication tools open on one screen while
working on another helps maintain constant contact with
team members. This is particularly useful in today’s
hybrid work environments, where digital communication
is key.
• Increased Employee Satisfaction and Retention:
Team members equipped with dual monitors often
experience less stress and frustration, leading to higher
job satisfaction. This ergonomic and productivity-focused
approach has also been linked to improved employee
retention rates.
• Better Customer Service: Dual screens can greatly
bene t customer service representatives. Having
customer information on one screen while managing
service tools and databases on the other can lead to
faster resolution times and higher customer satisfaction.

Sustained Bene ts Over Time
The initial boost in productivity was just the beginning.
Over the years, this setup has not only sustained its bene ts
but also adapted to new technological advancements,
maintaining MSI’s lead in workplace innovation.

Starting in Q4 of 2022, we have added single large curved
screens, 49 inches long, to our technological arsenal. These
screens are invaluable for tasks requiring a wide view, such
as analyzing extensive analytical reports. They o er the
exibility to be divided into up to four screens,
simultaneously accommodating various applications and

As a member of the analyst team, I believe that using
multiple screens has signi cantly increased our
productivity and work e ciency, especially when working
with big data. The multiple screens facilitate multitasking,
which greatly enhances our performance. – Tapan Patra
(Assistant Manager: Analysis Team, MSIS, Bangalore,
India)

Challenges and Considerations
Despite the clear advantages, adopting dual monitors was
not without its challenges. It required a signi cant upfront
investment and a shift in IT infrastructure. At the time of
initial adoption, when MSI Services team went to procure
dual monitors in the Indian market, most PC vendors
hadn’t even heard of the concept and it took some time to
procure the appropriate hardware. However, the strategic
foresight to implement this change has paid dividends, far
outweighing the initial setup costs and hiccups.

Account Receivable - SCARE
Costs - An Innovative Tool
This chapter discusses the introduction of MSI's SCARE Costs
system, which tracks and analyzes transactional expenses such as
shipping, credit card fees, and restocking. By providing
transparency and insights into the true pro tability of each
transaction, the system empowers employees to make informed,
entrepreneurial decisions, fostering a more strategic and e cient
business environment.

ffi

fi

574

n 2009, MSI introduced a groundbreaking concept
known as SCARE Costs to promote entrepreneurship
and transparency, which lies at the heart of our business
philosophy. SCARE Costs revolutionized our accounts
receivable practices, o ering a fresh approach to
understanding the true cost of doing business. This
innovative idea allows MSI to record and analyze the costs
associated with every transaction in a way that adds value
and insight.

SCARE is an acronym derived from:
• Shipping Expenses – freight cost of the transaction.
• Credit Card Charges – Expenses incurred by MSI
when customers pay by credit cards
• A/R expenses – Finance cost associated with the time
taken by the customer to pay their open balance

ff

575

• Restocking Charges – The cost of processing returned
material and restocking it.
• Other Expenses – All other expenses, such as
merchandising, rebates, holding costs, etc.
This system allows MSI to constantly ne-tune our
business practices, moving at the speed of imagination to
deliver the most value to our trading partners. Through
SCARE Costs, we have created a unique approach that
optimizes resource usage, builds value, and di erentiates
us in the marketplace. By translating transactional data into
actionable business insights, SCARE Costs bring
transparency at multiple levels.

The Power of Transparency
SCARE Costs provide us with a new lens through which
to view our business transactions. It presents a clear
picture of customer behavior, enabling us to adjust our
sales strategies to better align with each customer’s
business model. This visibility allows us to track, compare,
and re ne our business practices in real time. The true
power of SCARE Costs lies in its ability to bring granular
details to the forefront, ensuring that every transaction is
measured and understood in terms of its actual
pro tability.

The Decisions That Matter
SCARE Costs empower our team to make informed
decisions. How you conduct business with your customers,

ff

fi

fi

fi

576

based on their transactional behavior, is up to you. SCARE
simply provides the tools to visualize and understand that
behavior.
• Comparative Analysis: SCARE Costs enable easy
comparisons between customers, salespeople, or team
performances, ensuring that we can measure success on
a level playing eld. This apples-to-apples comparison
helps us understand each transaction’s true pro tability
and drives behavior change across our organization.
• Entrepreneurial Empowerment: By providing
salespeople with the freedom to tailor transactions
according to their customers' needs, SCARE promotes
entrepreneurial thinking. The saying "With freedom
comes responsibility" rings true here. SCARE helps us
determine not only who we should do business with but
also who we might choose to avoid.

fi

fi

577

• Accurate Cost Allocation: SCARE Costs give us the
ability to accurately allocate and measure the expenses
involved in generating revenue, beyond just the cost of
goods sold (COGS). This comprehensive understanding of
transaction costs allows us to make more informed
decisions that drive pro tability.
As a result, MSI has cultivated a culture that emphasizes
optimal resource utilization, cost reduction, and
productivity enhancement. SCARE Costs also help ensure
accountability across the board, as everyone is
empowered to make entrepreneurial decisions within
their sphere of in uence.
Kush Shah (Vice President: Business Innovation) sums
it up: "SCARE Costs allow each individual to make
entrepreneurial decisions in their spheres of in uence."

Keeping it Simple
Imagine you own a ower shop. Every day, you buy
1,000 fresh roses with the goal of selling them for a pro t.
But beyond the cost of the roses themselves, you’ve
invested in supplies like containers, oral tape, wrapping
paper, and more—adding $0.50 to the cost of each rose. You
also pay for shipping, credit card fees, and other expenses.
If you don’t account for all these costs when setting your
prices, you could end up with lower pro ts or even a loss.
Many businesses overlook these granular costs, failing to
provide their sales teams with the visibility needed to make
informed decisions. SCARE Costs are one of MSI’s key
innovations, enabled by technolo y, to track and allocate

fi

fl

fi

fl

g

fi

fl

fl

578

every expense related to each transaction. It’s crucial to
understand that these are not additional charges—they’re
the inherent costs of doing business, now made visible.
SCARE Costs help us maintain pro t margins across all
customers, regardless of their purchasing behavior.

Clarifying the Confusion
Some expenses are di cult to assign accurately, which is
why many companies label them as overhead costs and
ignore them at the transactional level. MSI, however, has
leveraged technolo y to e ectively calculate and allocate
these expenses as accurately as possible.

Our leaders continuously re ne the accuracy of these
allocations and the work ows related to SCARE Costs to
ensure fairness and transparency. For example, in August
2021, MSI began charging a transaction fee for all payments
made by credit card. Initially, there were concerns that
these fees were being allocated without considering their

fi

fi

ff

fl

ffi

g

579

It’s important to note that SCARE Costs can have both
positive and negative e ects on pro t margins. For
instance, when invoices are paid within 45 days, the
nance cost decreases, thus increasing the margin.
Conversely, invoices paid after 45 days incur higher nance
costs, reducing the margin.

The Bottom Line
SCARE Costs have unlocked a new level of business
pro ciency at MSI, bene ting all stakeholders by driving
behavior change. This innovative approach maximizes
resource utilization, adapts to diverse business patterns,
and ensures pro tability across all transactions. When fully
understood, SCARE is a powerful tool. As Aakash Mehta
(Senior Sales Representative: CAOR) aptly put it, "We
shouldn’t call it SCARE; we should call it CARES!"

impact on overall pro tability. In response, the process was
adjusted to charge customers a fee when paying by credit
card, and the Credit Card SCARE Costs were recalculated to
re ect the net expenses after fee collections.

Non-Technolo y Challenges:
Managing MSI's Warehouse Cities

This chapter highlights how MSI manages its warehouses like selfcontained cities, focusing on strategic space utilization, tra c
control, and safety. By optimizing vertical storage and organizing

across its expansive warehouse network, contributing to the
company's overall productivity and success.

anu Shah, with his visionary leadership, has
always believed that each warehouse location of
MSI is not just a storage facility but a city. This chapter
explores how Manu conceptualized and managed each
branch as a self-contained city, addressing non-technolo y
challenges with innovative solutions to ensure smooth
operations and exceptional service with the highest safety
and dense storage. In managing MSI's extensive operations,
Manu viewed each warehouse location as a self-contained
city, with the Branch/Warehouse Manager serving as the
City Manager. This perspective emphasized the importance
of strategic planning and e cient management at every
site. Manu grew up with 5 siblings and Mom and Dad (Total
8) from 1951 to 1963 in a 390 sq. ft. home in the suburb of
Mumbai. Every sq. ft. of space was important during the
day and night. That is where Manu learned how best to
utilize space and how to get rid of unneeded stu around
the house – how to get dual or triple vertical space
everywhere. Rika's story is very similar. Space utilization

The Role of a Branch/Warehouse Manager
For Manu, the Branch/Warehouse Manager was akin to a
City Manager. This role encompassed a wide range of
responsibilities, from space planning and tra c control to
garbage disposal and safety management. The manager’s
duties extended to creating a welcoming environment for
visitors and ensuring the welfare of employees, mirroring
the multifaceted responsibilities of managing a small city.

The Governor of MSI Cities: Senior Vice
President of Operations
At the helm of all MSI "cities" is the Senior Vice President
of Operations, who acts as the Governor of these
warehouse cities. This executive's responsibilities include:
•
Overall Coordination: Ensuring all branches
operate smoothly and e ciently.
•
Strategic Planning: Overseeing long-term planning
and development of warehouse infrastructure.
•

reclamation projects are sustainable and environmentally
friendly.
Cost E ciency: Reducing the need for new land
acquisition by optimizing existing resources.
Here is an example of Land reclamation.
Many of MSI facilities have or had railroad access from
1950’s. None of them serve MSI by Rail anymore. Those
were bulk supply before the days of Containers. All that
land is owned by properties railroad passing thru. Railroad
has right of way from each property. Rail may be live few
times a week or dead- No longer being use. At our HQ in

ffi

587

Orange CA as per attached pdf one edge had 1650 Feet long
and other side 500 feet edge. Railroad now are never wider
than 10.5 feet – so total clear path needed can be 20 feet. So
Manu with Kishor at MSI decided to reclaim the space over
20’ wide. Total reclaimed on one side was 26000 sq feet
and on another side 2000 sqft. Several other MSI facilities –
old rails were converted in to usable space by adding
concrete over it. Every Sq feet matters!

Welcoming Visitors
Creating a welcoming environment for visitors is also a key
responsibility. This involves:
Visitor Management: Ensuring that visitors are greeted
and guided properly.

588

Aesthetic Maintenance: Keeping the warehouse and
surrounding areas clean and presentable.
Customer Experience: Providing a positive customer
experience through e cient and courteous service.

The Scale of MSI's Operations
By 2024, MSI operates 57 warehouse cities across 6000
acres of land, encompassing six million square feet of
warehouse space. These facilities are supported by a robust
workforce and extensive logistics infrastructure, including:
Employees: Over 1200 blue-collar employees ensuring the
smooth operation of each warehouse city.
Delivery Vehicles: A eet of 350 delivery vehicles
facilitating timely and e cient deliveries.
Forklifts: Nearly 500 forklifts in operation across the
warehouses.

Conclusion: Building a City within a
Warehouse
Manu’s innovative approach to managing MSI’s
warehouse locations as cities has been instrumental in the
company’s success. By addressing non-technolo y
challenges with creativity and strategic planning, MSI
ensures that its operations are e cient, sustainable, and
conducive to employee and customer satisfaction.

onitoring
employee
turnover is crucial for
maintaining the
organizational health
of MSI. High turnover
rates can indicate
underlying issues
within the company, a ecting productivity, morale, and
nancial stability. Understanding turnover patterns helps
MSI implement strategies to retain talent and foster a
positive work environment.

Data Collection
Data is collected from MSI’s human resources
information system (HRIS), exit interviews, and employee

detect seasonal patterns.
• Last 2 Months Over Previous Year Same Two Months:
To compare recent turnover with the same period in the
previous year.
• Last Two Quarters vs. Last Two Years Same Quarter:
To analyze quarterly turnover over two years to observe
long-term trends.
592

• Last 4 Years: To examine long-term turnover patterns
to identify persistent issues.
• By Country: To identify turnover rates by country,
revealing potential cultural or economic factors a ecting
employee retention.
• By Employee Level: To analyze turnover among
di erent levels (entry, mid, senior) to understand where
attrition is highest.
• By Team Type: To compare turnover rates between
di erent team types (sales, technical, administrative).
• By Pay State and Pay Type: To examine how
compensation structure (salary, hourly) in uences
turnover.
• By Hiring Date: To look at turnover based on hiring
periods to identify trends in employee longevity.
• By Reporting to (Supervisor): To assess the impact of
direct supervisors on employee retention.

fi

ff

ff

ff

593

• By Designation: To investigate turnover among various
job titles to nd roles with higher attrition.

Findings & Key Insights:
Certain countries or locations have a higher turnover,
which suggests potential cultural or regional economic
issues.
Another interesting observation is that senior-level
employees exhibit lower turnover rates compared to entrylevel.
Sales teams show higher turnover, indicating potential
job stress or dissatisfaction -– Some of them may be in the
wrong bus!
Hourly employees have higher turnover rates than
salaried employees. Often times, we nd out through deep
analysis that this could be due to the lack of proper training
or wrong expectations at the time of hiring. MSI never lays
o employees for the lack of work and gives upto 25%
overtime for most blue-collar workers. Almost everyone
gets some yearly bonus at MSI.
Employees hired during economic booms tend to leave
sooner. Many of MSI’s branches/ warehouses are located
next to Amazon or Target or other big box companies. This
is an advantage but name recognition can be a problem
when compared to national brands.

QR Codes: Streamlining MSI
Business with Smart
Technolo y
This chapter highlights MSI’s integration of QR codes, starting in
2014, to enhance e ciency across various aspects of the business.
QR codes are used in inventory tracking, order processing, product
samples, and even business cards, streamlining operations and
reducing errors. This technological innovation has improved both
internal work ows and customer engagement, reinforcing MSI’s
commitment to operational excellence.

he COVID 19 pandemic catapulted the Quick
Response Codes (QR codes) into widespread
commercial use. From restaurants to retailers, everyone
started using QR Codes for providing menus to coupons to
be consumed contact-free. Long before the world at large
harnessed the power and versatility of the QR codes, MSI
was already incorporating them in various business and
marketing use cases. We were early adopters of QR codes to

streamline various processes, improve e ciency, and
increase customer engagement and experience. Today
everywhere you look in an MSI campus, you will see QR
codes: from LOT labels to door access and from business
cards to printed catalogs and ads.
MSI used QR codes in various ways since 2014, such as
inventory tracking, order processing, customer service,
marketing, and advertising.

ffi

-

601

MSI rst started using QR
Codes on our business
cards. Not only did they
make our business cards
more interactive, but they
also provided a convenient
and innovative way to pack a
lot of contact information in a small space. QR codes on our
business cards helped increase our visibility and made it
easier for our team members to digitally share their contact
information and reduce the use of paper cards. Paper cards
often get tossed around and possibly lost. With the QR
codes, we got directly into our customer’s smartphones
with a click of a button.
Incorporating QR codes into our sample products was a
revolutionary step taken by MSI, and we are proud to have
been the rst in the industry to do so. Our entire company
travels with the customer with QR codes on our samples.
By simply scanning the code, they can access complete and
up-to-date information they need about the product,
creating a lasting impression and solidifying the connection
with our brand. Not only does this bene t our customers,
but it also streamlines the sample order ful llment and
replenishment process for our team, making it easier for
them to track and manage the samples.

QR Codes for
QR Codes to Identify
Showroom Displays
LOTs
QR Codes for
Identifying Warehouse
Bulk Locations

QR codes are also a par t of our warehouse
management system (WMS) to streamline and improve
our ful llment processes. Some uses of QR codes in MSI
WMS include:
• Tracking inventory: QR codes representing the Lot
number and pallet numbers are attached to inventory
and scanned at various points in the warehouse to track
its location and movements.
• Picking and packing: QR codes guide our workers by
ensuring that the correct items are selected and packed
for each order.

fi

603

• Receiving: QR codes verify that the correct items have
been received and stored in the correct location.
• Shipping: QR codes are being used to identify pallets
and orders within a shipment.
Implementing QR code tracking in our WMS has
signi cantly enhanced e ciency and accuracy by tracking
the location and movements of each item, improving
inventory management, and reducing errors. We scan QR
codes approximately half a million times a month in the
warehouse. 55% of these scans are for inventory, 30% for
picking, 10% for shipping, and 5% for other activities.
Since implementing mandatory QR code scanning for
picking activities in the hubs, we’ve seen a 50% drop in
wrong material shipment errors. Additionally, QR
scanning on outbound shipping helps reduce left-o pallets
and ensures accurate tracking.
One of the greatest bene ts of QR technolo y is that it is
extremely fault tolerant and can easily recognize bent or
partially blocked codes. For example, you could run a
sharpie through a 2″x2″ QR code, and it is still likely to
recognize it. QR codes can take up to 30% structural
damage and still be recognizable. This makes them
perfectly suited for the unforgiving environment of a
warehouse.
We continue to look for opportunities to automate the
thinking side of warehouse tasks – i.e. by transitioning typing
to scanning and leverage AI/Big Data to predict potential
inventory related errors. – Matthew Zucker, Team Leader :
Operations Team, MSI, Orange, California.

Using randomized QR codes for clocking in and out of
our warehouse has greatly improved the speed and
precision of our timekeeping system. We can track when
employees start and end their shifts by attaching QR codes
and linking them to our timekeeping software. It eliminates
the need for traditional time clocks or manual record
keeping. Additionally, using QR codes for clocking in and
out has allowed us to ensure the validity of the time clock
entries.
Using QR codes for accessing doors has greatly
improved security and convenience in our workplace. By
attaching QR codes to our o ce and warehouse building
doors, employees can use their smart devices to scan and
open the doors they are authorized for. This system also
allows us to grant or revoke employee access as and when
needed quickly. Additionally, using QR codes for door
access has allowed us to track who enters and exits
di erent parts of our buildings.
The amazing bene ts of using these tiny QR codes don’t
stop here. They can bridge physical and digital shopping
experiences, allowing users to access information easily.
Typing a long URL to visit websites, especially for di erent
products, can be cumbersome and discouraging to our
customers when they are browsing our showrooms or
catalogs. QR codes simplify that process and provide
instant grati cation for customers seeking more
information about the product, creating a pull e ect. Some
potential bene ts of using QR codes on catalogs include the
following:

605

• Enhanced accessibility: QR codes are easily scanned
with a smartphone or other smart device, allowing our
customers to quickly access information about our
products or services without needing a computer.
• Improved e ciency: QR codes streamline the
ordering process, allowing customers to easily place
orders or request more information without manually
entering product or contact details.
• Enhanced engagement: QR codes allow customers to
access interactive and engaging content, such as
visualizers, videos, demonstrations, or social media
pro les, which helps them learn more about our
products and connect with us in a more meaningful way.
We have seen great success with nearly 100,000 clicks
from showrooms, samples, and advertising QR codes
from January 2022 to January 2023.
QR codes also leverage cutting-edge technologies such as
drones and self-service lockers. By using QR codes to
interact with these technologies, we are able to streamline
processes and improve e ciency and accuracy. For
example, we are using drones to scan the QR codes to
check what inventory is sitting in which rack location.
MSI has always prided itself in being able to leverage
“High-Tech in a traditionally Low-Tech industry” to
optimize a commodity business and gain a competitive
advantage. Using QR codes is one such example. We
continue to leverage the power of QR codes in newer use
cases.

MSI Drones Take Flight
This chapter outlines MSI’s integration of drone technolo y to
enhance inventory management across its large warehouses. Faced
with challenges in manually tracking inventory and managing
replenishment in dynamic racking locations, MSI deployed
autonomous drones to streamline these processes. The drones
provide real-time data, improving accuracy and e ciency by
scanning inventory, capturing visual records, and triggering
replenishments. Despite some challenges, such as label
mismanagement and environmental factors, drones have
signi cantly improved inventory accuracy, reduced manual labor,
and contributed to MSI’s overall operational e ciency, including
outdoor monitoring. The chapter highlights MSI's commitment to
leveraging innovative technolo y for growth and e ciency.

n MSI’s operations, units are stored in rack systems for
easy retrieval, with two types of bin locations: static
and dynamic. However, larger warehouses such as Orange,
California, Edison, New Jersey, the new Savannah, and the
upcoming port of Houston, have thousands of racking

locations. Ensuring accurate registration and tracking of
each pallet in the Wide Area Multilateration system has
become a challenge, particularly with dynamic locations.
As the order volume grows, proactively restocking depleted
and managing almost depleted rack inventory is
challenging, particularly a ecting the static locations used
for picking. To tackle these challenges, MSI is integrating
drone technolo y into its product lines to strategically
make use of the technolo y.
The current manual process of recording inventory
location and managing replenishment is resource-intensive

ff

g

g

636

and prone to human error. To make this process more
e ective and e cient, an automated solution is necessary.
Such a solution could provide accurate inventory counts,
identify empty racks for replenishment, and optimize the
use of warehouse resources. By automating these tasks, the
system could become the primary driver for inventory
management and replenishment in the racking storage. The
deployment of drone technolo y is proving to serve as the
foundation for such an automated solution, providing realtime inventory data and facilitating e cient replenishment.

What We Did
Developing and implementing a new technolo y solution
is a time-consuming and rigorous process that requires a lot
of thought and experimentation. Before deploying the
Corvus drones in our warehouses, we tried several other
methods that did not work for our speci c use case. About
seven years ago, Kush Shah (Vice President: Business
Innovation) led a project to build an in-house drone that fell
short of the goal of autonomous ight.
We also explored other technologies, including the use of
passive Radio-frequency identi cation tags on pallets,
forklift-mounted cameras, and pushcart-mounted iPads
with lidar, among others. Each of these methods presented
its own challenges that led to failure. Some had accuracy
issues, while others had physical obstructions and technical
limitations. We eventually focused our scope managing on
the single-deep racking, where we explored several
concepts before nally settling on the use of drones to
improve inventory tracking. Through this experience, we
learned that innovation requires patience, persistence, and

g

fi

ffi

fi

fl

g

fi

ffi

ff

637

an openness to try new ideas and methods without the fear
of failure.
Today, MSI has deployed autonomous drones that y
through the racks on predetermined schedules and paths.
These drones have two questions to answer: 1) What
inventory is sitting in which location? 2) How much of the
inventory is sitting in that location? (Is replenishment
required). The drones read the Lot QR codes on each pallet
and the item–location for each item on the rack. They also
visually estimate the occupancy of the rack and updates the
Wide Area Multilateration to trigger a replenishment if
required. Each time the drone passes the rack location, it
scans and stores a snapshot and a video for post- ight
audits. Drones have become the new and improved “eyes”
in MSI warehouses, o ering faster and more accurate
monitoring capabilities.
We want to integrate the drone technolo y with our
product lines and strategically leverage the technolo y to
drive e ciency, accuracy, and innovation. - Adaliza Diaz
Petrakakos (Operations Director, MSI, New Jersey).

Bene ts Of Using Drones To Track Inventory
• E ciency Boost: The adoption of drone technolo y
has dramatically increased the e ciency of our inventory
tracking process, reducing the time required compared
to manual scanning methods.
• Better Visibility & Auditing Capabilities: Drones
provide a snapshot of the pictures and videos from each
scan, which can be used for post-scan audits. This allows

• Autonomous Navigation: Drones are equipped with
3D mapping technolo y that enables them to
autonomously navigate the warehouse, including auto
docking. This reduces the need for human intervention,
helps keep MSI storage exible, and increases the speed
of scanning.
• Audit against the WAM System: The drone data is
easily mapped with MSI’s WAM data to verify and correct
discrepancies in the WAM system due to manual
processing.
• Data-sharing Capabilities: The drones have local
networking capabilities, allowing them to share data with
the MSI’s systems.
• Spotting Inaccuracies: The drone technolo y also
helps to identify discrepancies in tracking our Rack
inventory. For example in the Orange, California
warehouse, the drones nd about 30 discrepancies per
ight related to Lot Labels or WAM data. A drone scans
about 200 220 rack locations per ight.
The implementation of drone technolo y has had a
signi cant impact on our WAM accuracy. Our Edison, New
Jersey warehouse saw an improvement from a variance
of approximately 6% in November to 3% in January. This
improvement has allowed us to better ful ll customer
orders. Currently, we perform audits of our Edison, New
Jersey racking manually, but once all ve drones are in

us to better understand our inventory and the state of
our warehouse at any given time.

Perfecting our inventory accuracy, especially in our
ooring business, is a critical milestone for the Operations
Team to scale towards $5 Billion goal. I envision drones
help us to get there. - Reg y Soenarso (Senior Vice
President, Operations, MSI, Orange, California).

Challenges
There are also some challenges with deploying drones.
To e ectively use drones, it is important that the inventory
is properly labeled and placed in an organized manner.
Often times the labels are missing, or damaged, or multiple
labels are placed on the same pallet leading to missed or
inaccurate readings.
Another challenge is the maintenance of drones. Our
warehouses, which have high dust environments, require
maintenance and the drones need to be constantly checked
and cleaned to ensure proper functioning. The dust and
debris can a ect the camera lenses of the drones.
Additionally, environment al conditions such as
temperature and lighting in the warehouse can also impact
the range and accuracy of the drones.
The use of drone technolo y in the warehouse is
therefore in uencing behavior to have better labeling and

g

place, we can reduce the need for these manual audits. On
average, each ight in January saw the drones scanning
110 locations in Edison, New Jersey. With these timesaving and accuracy-enhancing capabilities, the dronebased inventory tracking solution is proving to be a
valuable asset for our warehouse operations.

proper care of the warehouse environment to overcome
some of these challenges.

Drones Outside The Warehouse
Our use of drones is not limited to just the rack space
inside our facilities, but also extends to the outdoors. In
Orange, California and Edison, New Jersey, we have
deployed GPS-enabled autonomous drones that literally
give a bird’s eye view of our facilities and help in
monitoring the tra c and parking situation. We also use
drones to monitor the condition of our exteriors. One of
the key bene ts of using drones for this purpose is the
ability to quickly and easily survey large areas without
having to physically inspect them. This has allowed us to
proactively identify and address potential issues quickly
and e ectively, saving us costly oversights.

Conclusion
Embracing technolo y is not easy. It is prone to multiple
failures before success can be achieved. However, if we stay
focused on the big picture as the drone does from a few
hundred feet above, we can derive value from it. New
technolo y and solutions not only help us do what we do
more accurately and e ciently but also in uence our
behavior to improve upon certain bad practices. We are
constantly looking for new ways to improve and make our
operations more e cient and the use of drones is just the
beginning.

Philanthropy and Strategic
Giving: A Legacy of Impact
Manu’s philanthropic journey, rooted in empathy and early acts
of kindness, evolved into strategic giving focused on job creation,
education, and healthcare. His initiatives, including vision care,
anemia prevention, and early childhood development, aim to make
a lasting impact on communities worldwide. Manu’s philosophy
emphasizes the transformative power of giving, aiming to inspire
others through his actions. His legacy is about creating positive
change and using innovation to enhance his philanthropic e orts.

ff

645

anu’s philanthropic journey began long before he
could de ne it. Growing up in a large family with
modest resources, he learned early on the importance of
kindness and empathy. "Education was the only way out of
poverty for my family," he often recalls, highlighting how
education became the cornerstone of his life’s purpose.
Even as a student, Manu felt compelled to share his limited
resources with those who had even less, whether it was
o ering his lunch or tutoring classmates. These small but
signi cant acts of kindness laid the foundation for a lifetime
of giving back.
Manu’s early experiences shaped his understanding of
philanthropy in its simplest form—helping others when you
can. "The word 'philanthropy' probably did not occur to me
until I was at least 50 years old," he admits. His generosity
was a natural extension of his empathy, a trait that would
later expand into more formal philanthropic e orts as his
business success grew.

From Acts of Kindness to Strategic
Philanthropy
As Manu’s career progressed, so did his ability to make a
broader impact. His informal acts of kindness evolved into
more structured and strategic initiatives as he realized that
his contributions could a ect entire communities. "I started
to see how my contributions could create a ripple e ect,
bene ting not just individuals but entire networks of
people," he says.

ff

This strategic approach led Manu to focus on key areas
where he could make a measurable di erence. Education,
healthcare, and job creation became central to his
philanthropic e orts. As he gained more clarity on the
needs around him, he sought out ways to make his
contributions scalable, ensuring that they had a lasting
impact. "I realized that philanthropy could be much more
than just helping one person at a time. It could help
reshape entire systems and communities."

Job Creation: A Powerful Form of
Philanthropy

For Manu, job creation is more than just a business goal;
it’s a form of philanthropy in itself. His belief in the power
of employment to transform lives is deeply ingrained.
"Creating jobs is in my rst nature," he emphasizes. Manu’s
business ventures, particularly MSI, have created
thousands of jobs worldwide, and he views each of those

ff

fi

ff

647

jobs as an opportunity for individuals to better their lives
and support their families.
The impact of job creation is particularly felt in rural
areas, where employment opportunities are often scarce.
Manu is proud of the role his companies have played in
providing sustainable jobs that not only o er nancial
security but also contribute to the overall well-being of
communities. "When you create jobs, you create
independence. People can take care of their families,
educate their children, and ultimately, their communities
grow stronger," he says.
His philosophy aligns with that of other in uential
business leaders, like Howard Schultz, who has spoken
extensively about the importance of investing in people.

Advancing Healthcare
through Innovation –
Manu’s Vision for Vision
Care
and
Anemia
Prevention
This chapter discusses Manu Shah's commitment to advancing
healthcare through innovative, scalable solutions, particularly in
the areas of vision care and anemia prevention. Inspired by his
personal experiences with both issues, Manu focuses on using noninvasive technologies and local partnerships to improve access to
healthcare in underserved communities. His vision care initiative,
the Chashma Project, aims to provide eyeglasses to millions through
portable autorefractors and local production. His anemia initiative
leverages smartphone technolo y for early detection and
emphasizes education and nutrition to tackle root causes. Manu’s
healthcare approach is built on detection, treatment, and
community empowerment, striving to create sustainable solutions
for health equity.

g

663

anu’s personal journey into healthcare began in
his teenage years when he discovered that he had
vision problems and was anemic. Growing up in a large
family with limited access to healthcare, Manu wasn’t
aware that he needed glasses until a friend convinced him
to visit an optometrist. Similarly, he faced fatigue and
health issues in his youth due to anemia, a condition
caused by a lack of nutrition and awareness. These early
challenges sparked his commitment to ensuring that others
wouldn't su er from preventable health issues due to a lack
of access or education.
Today, Manu’s healthcare vision focuses on scalable, noninvasive technologies that can be deployed in resourceconstrained settings, making healthcare accessible to
millions. He believes in leveraging cutting- edge
technologies combined with strong local partnerships to
create sustainable solutions for two major health
challenges: vision care and anemia.

Vision Care: Solving a Global Crisis
At least 1 billion people
globally su er from vision
impairment, primarily due
to uncorrected refractive
errors. These impairments
a ect individuals' ability to
work, study, and lead
productive lives, resulting
in billions of dollars in lost
economic output. Despite

ff

ff

ff

664

the availability of a ordable eyeglasses, a lack of access to
vision care persists in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). This challenge is compounded by the shortage of
optometrists and the limited awareness of vision
impairment in underserved communities.
Manu’s vision care initiative, the Chashma Project, was
created to tackle this issue by providing a ordable, scalable
solutions. The project aims to screen 40 million eyes and
provide eyeglasses to 5 million people over ve years. This
initiative combines technolo y with local entrepreneurship,
ensuring that communities not only receive vision care but
also bene t from job creation and economic development.

Innovative Technolo y and Approach
The key innovation in the Chashma Project is the use of
portable autorefractors, devices that can diagnose
refractive errors in just 20 seconds. These devices are userfriendly and require minimal training, enabling local
healthcare workers to conduct vision screenings in even
the most remote areas. The autorefractors are highly
accurate and e cient, allowing up to 50,000 patients to be
screened per device each year.
Once a patient’s prescription is determined, eyeglasses
can be made locally for as little as USD 1 per pair, using
durable materials and a simple manufacturing process. By
involving local communities in the production and
distribution of eyeglasses, Manu’s vision care initiative not
only addresses a critical health need but also fosters local
entrepreneurship.

fi

665

Partnerships and Progress
To implement this vision, Manu has partnered with large
scale nonpro t organizations, which have extensive
experience in healthcare delivery. These partnerships
ensure that the initiative reaches the people who need it
most. The Chashma Project has already screened 100,000
individuals in its initial phase, with 25 30% of those
screened requiring eyeglasses. Additionally, the project has
referred thousands of patients for cataract surgeries,
further expanding its impact.
With plans to scale up to 1 million eye examinations in
2023 alone, the Chashma Project is well on its way to
meeting its ambitious goals. The combination of advanced
technolo y, loc al par tnerships, and communit y
involvement is key to its success.

Anemia: Tackling a Silent Crisis
Anemia is a widespread health
issue, a ecting over 600 million
people worldwide. In India,
more than half of women aged
15 49 are anemic, a condition
that not only impacts individual
health but also undermines
economic productivity. Anemia
is primarily caused by iron
de cienc y, but it is often

-

fi

g

ff

fi

-

666

exacerbated by poor nutrition, lack of healthcare access,
and low awareness about the condition.
Manu’s personal experience with anemia has fueled his
passion for addressing this issue on a large scale. He
recognizes that while anemia is preventable and treatable,
millions of people continue to su er due to gaps in
detection and treatment. Manu’s approach focuses on
scalable, non-invasive technologies for early detection,
combined with education and nutritional support.

Cutting-Edge Detection Technologies
To address the anemia crisis, Manu has pioneered the
use of non-invasive technologies that can detect anemia
through simple, accessible methods. One of these
technologies uses smartphone cameras to analyze the color
of a patient’s inner eyelid, providing an accurate
assessment of hemoglobin levels without the need for
invasive blood tests. Another approach involves using
photos of patients’ ngernails to detect low hemoglobin
levels. Both technologies are designed to be used in
resource-limited settings, where traditional diagnostic tools
are unavailable.
These innovations make it possible to screen large
populations quickly and cost-e ectively, ensuring that
those at risk of anemia can be identi ed early and treated
appropriately. By integrating these technologies into
community health programs, Manu aims to screen 1 million
people for anemia over the next ve years.

fi

ff

ff

fi

fi

667

Holistic Approach: Education and Nutrition
Detection is only one part of the solution. Manu
recognizes that anemia prevention requires a multifaceted
approach, including education and nutritional support.
Through partnerships with organizations like Akshaya
Patra, which provides mid-day meals to schoolchildren,
and Ekal Vidyalaya, which focuses on education in rural
areas, Manu is integrating anemia prevention into existing
programs.
By raising awareness about the importance of a balanced
diet, particularly iron-rich foods, Manu’s initiative is
helping to combat the root causes of anemia. In addition,
the program provides iron supplements and nutritional
support to those most at risk, particularly women and
children. The goal is to reduce anemia rates by 20% in the
target populations over the next ve years.

Theory of Change
Manu’s approach to healthcare is grounded in a theory of
change that emphasizes scalability, sustainability, and
community involvement. His vision is to leverage
technolo y to solve some of the most pressing healthcare
challenges in LMICs, ensuring that solutions are accessible
and a ordable for all. By working with trusted local
partners and creating jobs within communities, Manu is
building healthcare systems that are not only e ective but
also sustainable in the long term.

668

In both the vision care and anemia initiatives, Manu’s
theory of change relies on three key components:
1. Detection – Using cutting-edge, non-invasive
technologies to identify health issues early and accurately.
2. Treatment – Providing a ordable solutions, such as
low-cost eyeglasses and nutritional supplements, that
address the health needs of the population.
3. Empowerment – Engaging local communities in the
production and distribution of healthcare solutions,
creating jobs and fostering economic development.

Impact and Future Goals
Manu’s vision care initiative has already screened
100,000 individuals, with plans to scale up to 1 million
screenings in 2023. By the end of the ve-year plan, the
project aims to reach 40 million people, providing
eyeglasses to 5 million of them. The impact of this project is
not only measured in terms of improved vision but also in
the economic empowerment of local communities through
job creation and entrepreneurship.
The anemia project, still in its early stages, is poised to
make a similar impact. By combining early detection with
education and nutritional support, Manu’s initiative aims to
reduce anemia rates and improve overall health outcomes
for millions of people.

partnerships with organizations like Pratham, Manu is
helping to build a world where every child has access to
quality education, regardless of their background or
circumstances.
As Manu often says, "Education is not just about lling
minds with knowledge; it’s about nurturing the whole
person." His philanthropic work re ects this holistic
approach, ensuring that children not only receive a quality
education but also the support they need to thrive.

integrating technolo y into education, making learning more
accessible and engaging. The rise of e-learning platforms, digital
content, and tablet-based learning systems has revolutionized how
education is delivered, especially in rural and underserved

ensuring that children in remote areas gain access to quality
education through digital means.
Cultural Context
1. Indian Values of Education and Knowledge Sharing:
Education has always been highly valued in Indian culture, with an
emphasis on lifelong learning and the belief that knowledge should
be shared. Manu Shah's initiatives, such as providing tablets to
children in rural areas and supporting Pratham’s educational
programs, re ect this cultural emphasis on spreading knowledge
and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to learn,
regardless of their socio-economic background.
2. The American Spirit of Innovation and Technological
Empowerment: The American approach to education often
involves leveraging technolo y and innovation to create scalable
solutions that address societal challenges. Manu’s collaboration

he ensured that the initiative could grow e ciently, much like a
business expanding its market reach. This strate y emphasizes the
importance of creating solutions that can be scaled up to address
larger societal challenges.
2. Leveraging Partnerships for Greater Impact: In
business, strategic partnerships are often essential for growth and
success. Manu’s collaboration with Pratham, Google, and other
organizations exempli es how e ective partnerships can amplify the
impact of educational initiatives, ensuring that resources, expertise,
and technolo y are e ectively utilized to bene t millions of children.
3. Investing in Future Skills: By supporting programs like
Pratham’s Creativity Clubs, which teach coding and digital content
creation, Manu is investing in the future workforce, equipping
students with skills necessary for the 21st-century job market. This
approach re ects a business-oriented understanding of how
education can serve as a foundation for economic growth and
empowerment, preparing children for future opportunities.

Quotes
Naveen Jain - “Philanthropy is not about giving money but
about solving problems.” —
Andrew Carnegie - “Wealth is not to feed our egos but to
feed the hungry and to help people help themselves.”
Manu Shah - “In the end, we will be remembered not for
what we have but for what we gave.”
Historical Context
•
The role of philanthropy in shaping modern societies has
been signi cant throughout history. For example, Andrew Carnegie,
one of the wealthiest men of the 19th century, famously said, "The

fl

fi

fi

699

man who dies rich dies disgraced." He spent much of his fortune on
libraries, education, and peace initiatives. Manu Shah and the
Sarva Mangal Family Trust embody this ethos of wealth serving the
common good by focusing on areas like healthcare, education, and
community development in underserved areas.
•
The growth of philanthropic e orts in India was marked by
the establishment of prominent trusts in the 20th century, such as
the Tata Trusts, which have made major contributions to health,
education, and technolo y. Similarly, the Shah family's trust
operates within this tradition, driving innovations in education,
healthcare, and technolo y to uplift millions globally.

Foundation
Manu and Rika Shah have woven philanthropy into their lives
and business through charitable vehicles such as Donor-Advised
Funds (DAFs), the Sarva Mangal Family Trust (SMFT), and the Shah
Happiness Foundation (SHF). Beginning with a DAF in 1995, they
structured their giving to maximize impact, eventually expanding
their e orts through SMFT, which also fosters charitable
involvement among MSI employees. In 2022, they launched SHF to
ensure the continuation of their philanthropic legacy, driven by
their belief in purposeful, long-term giving.

ff

701

hilanthropy encompasses various structures and
strategies for charitable giving. Let's break down the
three types of philanthropic vehicles you've mentioned:
Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), private family foundations,
and public foundations.

Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)
A DAF is a charitable giving vehicle administered by a
public charity. It allows donors to make a charitable
contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and
then recommend grants from the fund over time.
Advantages:
• Immediate Tax Deduction: Donors get an immediate
tax deduction for contributions, even if grants are made
in the future.

702

• Simplicity and Convenience: DAFs are easy to set up
and administer. The sponsoring organization handles all
the administrative tasks.
• Flexibility: Donors can recommend grants to various
charities over time.
• Privacy: Donors can choose to remain anonymous.
Disadvantages:
• Control: Donors have advisory privileges but not legal
control over the funds.
• Fees: There are management fees charged by the
sponsoring organization.
• Payout Requirements: There are no strict payout
requirements, which might delay funds reaching
charities.

Private Family Foundations
A private family foundation is a non-pro t organization
created and funded by an individual, family, or
corporation. It is usually governed by family members or
trustees.
Advantages:
• Control: Donors have full control over the foundation's
assets and grant-making decisions.
• Legacy: Foundations can be structured to continue for
generations, preserving the donor's legacy.
• Flexibility in Grant-making: Foundations can make
grants to individuals and international organizations,

fi

703

fund scholarships, and undertake other charitable
activities.
Disadvantages:
• Complexity and Cost: Setting up and maintaining a
private foundation involves signi cant legal, accounting,
and administrative work.
• Annual Distribution Requirement: Foundations must
distribute at least 5% of their assets annually.
• Public Disclosure: Foundations must le detailed
annual tax returns (Form 990 PF), which are publicly
available.

Public Foundations
Public foundations are non-pro t organizations that receive
funding from multiple sources, including individuals,
corporations, and government agencies. They typically
focus on speci c causes or communities.
Advantages:
• Broader Funding Base: Public foundations can attract
funds from a wide range of donors.
• Community Impact: They often have deep ties to
speci c communities or causes, allowing for targeted
impact.
• Professional Management: Public foundations typically
have professional sta to manage funds and grantmaking.

For Manu and Rika Shah, the spirit of giving has been an
integral part of their personal and professional lives. Their
philanthropic journey is not just about charity, but about
fostering a culture of generosity and impact within MSI and
beyond. This chapter delves into their charitable
endeavors, the foundations they’ve established, and their
commitment to meaningful, scalable philanthropy.

The Genesis of Giving: Donor-Advised Funds
Starting with DAF
In 1995, with a vision to make giving a structured part of
their life, Manu and Rika initiated a Donor-Advised Fund
(DAF) with Fidelity. Starting with an initial contribution of
$200,000, this fund was designed to simplify the giving
process, allowing them to contribute earnings and grow the
fund over time. This approach not only facilitated ongoing
donations without the immediate need to allocate
resources each year but also allowed them to strategically
plan their philanthropic activities.

Expanding the Reach: Sarva Mangal Family
Trust
SMFT Empowering MSI Employees and Beyond
In 2003, the Shahs took their commitment to
philanthropy further by establishing the Sarva Mangal
Family Trust (SMFT), translating to "Let All Be Happy." This
trust underscored their dedication not just to global causes

—

706

but also to their immediate MSI family. SMFT o ers
matching contributions up to $5,000 for every MSI
employee’s charitable donations, thereby extending the
culture of giving throughout the organization. This initiative
not only boosts the employees' morale but also ampli es
their impact on the charities they care about.

Fostering a Culture of Volunteerism and
Support
Encouraging Active Participation
Beyond nancial contributions, SMFT encourages a
culture of active volunteerism within MSI. Through
competitions and art from these events, the trust promotes
engagement and raises additional funds for charitable
causes. To date, SMFT supports over 40 non-pro t
organizations worldwide, often as a prime contributor or a
signi cant supporter. These organizations are carefully
selected based on their scalability, measurability, and
transparency to ensure that the contributions have the
most meaningful impact.

The Shah Happiness Foundation: Securing the
Future of Philanthropy
A New Chapter in Charitable Giving
In 2022, the Shahs expanded their philanthropic
framework by establishing the Shah Happiness Foundation
(SHF). With four full-time employees and growing, SHF
represents a strategic approach to long-term charitable

fi

giving. Through this foundation and their estate planning,
the Shahs are ensuring that their philanthropic vision will
continue to in uence and enact positive change, adhering
to Manu’s philosophy that the "last check should bounce,"
re ecting a life spent giving to the fullest.

Conclusion: The Ripple E ects of Generous
Leadership
The philanthropic initiatives started by Manu and Rika
Shah are more than acts of charity; they are a testament to
a life lived with generosity at its core. Through DAF, SMFT,
and SHF, they have not only contributed nancially but
have also cultivated an ethos of giving within MSI and the
broader community. This legacy of giving is a fundamental
aspect of their life’s work, ensuring that their impact will
continue to resonate well beyond their lifetimes.

War and Peace - Manu’s
Learning in Life
The Complex Relationship Between Destruction
and Reconstruction in the Context of War and
History
Manu Shah’s life and leadership philosophy are deeply rooted in
values of non-violence, integrity, and ethical confrontation, shaped
by his Jain upbringing and personal experiences with childhood
bullies. He learned early the importance of standing up against
wrongdoing, a principle he applied throughout his life and business.
Manu's approach to both personal and professional con icts
emphasizes resolving issues swiftly and fairly, avoiding destructive
competition, and fostering long-term trust. This commitment to
integrity helped build MSI into a company with strong ethical
practices and a culture of mutual respect.

fl

709

anu and Rika Shah, both born into Jain families,
have deeply embedded values of non-violence
(Ahimsa) and the pursuit of peaceful solutions. Jainism, an
ancient religion, emphasizes the sanctity of all life forms
and the importance of living in harmony. As a student of
history, Manu has always been intrigued by the paradox of
how signi cant progress often emerges from the aftermath
of destruction and war. Manu’s struggle is depicted here
into the intricate relationship between destruction,
reconstruction, and peace, and the lessons that can be
drawn from history.

Arguments for the Necessity of Destruction
1. Elimination of Threat
Sometimes, the destruction of military infrastructure,
oppressive regimes, or sources of con ict is necessary to
eliminate immediate threats and create conditions for
lasting peace. Historical examples include the dismantling
of totalitarian regimes that posed signi cant threats to
global security.
2. Catalyst for Change
Major con icts can expose deep-rooted societal issues
and injustices, acting as catalysts for change and reform.
For instance, the civil rights movements in various
countries often gained momentum following periods of
con ict and upheaval.
3. Uni cation
Shared experiences of hardship and loss during
wartime can sometimes lead to a sense of unity and

fi

fl

fl

fi

fi

fl

710

common purpose among a population. This unity can pave
the way for reconciliation and cooperation in the
aftermath, as seen in the reconstruction of Europe postWorld War II.

Arguments Against the Necessity of
Destruction
1. Humanitarian Cost
The destruction caused by war in icts immense
su ering and loss of life on civilian populations. The most
vulnerable members of society disproportionately bear this
cost. The humanitarian crises resulting from wars are often
profound and long-lasting.
2. Cycle of Violence
Destruction can perpetuate cycles of hatred and
violence, making long-term peace more di cult to achieve.
Trauma and resentment can linger for generations, fueling
future con icts. The Middle East con icts provide stark
examples of how destruction can lead to prolonged cycles
of violence.
3. Unintended Consequences
Wa r c a n h a v e u n f o r e s e e n a n d u n i n t e n d e d
consequences, destabilizing entire regions and creating
new con icts. The destruction of infrastructure and
institutions can set back development and progress by
decades, as seen in the prolonged instability in regions like
Afghanistan and Iraq.

ffi

fl

fl

fl

fl

ff

711

The Path to Reconstruction and Peace
1. Rebuilding with Justice and Equity
- The destruction caused by war can create
opportunities to rebuild societies in more just and
equitable ways. Post-war reconstruction e orts should
focus on addressing the root causes of con ict and
promoting social justice.
2. Promoting Reconciliation and Healing
- E orts to foster reconciliation and healing are crucial
for breaking cycles of violence. Truth and reconciliation
commissions, such as those in South Africa, have played
vital roles in addressing past injustices and promoting
national healing.
3. Investing in Humanitarian and Development Aid
- Providing humanitarian and development aid to wartorn regions can help rebuild infrastructure, support
displaced populations, and promote economic recovery.
International cooperation and support are essential for
successful reconstruction e orts.

Conclusion: Weighing the Costs and Bene ts
The relationship between destruction and reconstruction
or peace is not always linear or predictable. While
destruction can sometimes lead to positive change, it is not
a guaranteed or desirable outcome. The costs of war are
immense, and the path to peace and reconstruction is often
long and arduous.

depends on the speci c context, the goals of the con ict,
and the values and perspectives of those involved. It is
crucial to weigh the potential bene ts of destruction
against its enormous costs and to explore alternative paths
toward peace and reconciliation whenever possible.

Manu's Lesson: Confronting Evil When
Necessary-earlier the better
The Childhood Lessons
Manu's life has been marked by moments of profound
learning, often stemming from personal confrontations
with moral and ethical dilemmas. One of the most
signi cant lessons Manu learned and occasionally applied
throughout his life was, "There comes a time when evil or
evilness must be destroyed." This lesson was rooted in a
couple of formative incidents during his childhood.
At the age of nine, Manu encountered a challenging
situation involving a neighborhood teenager, a potential
hoodlum. This older boy convinced Manu to steal from his
oldest brother’s stamp collection. Manu did so twice before
realizing the immorality of his actions. When he attempted
to stop, the hoodlum resorted to blackmail, threatening to
report Manu to his family if he didn't continue stealing
more valuable stamps. After two sleepless nights lled with
anxiety and fear, Manu mustered the courage to confront
the teen hoodlum, telling him he was no longer afraid and
would no longer comply. This act of bravery ended the
blackmail, and when Manu reported the entire ordeal to his
older brother, he received praise and a blessing for his
integrity and courage.
Another de ning incident occurred when Manu was 14.
In a community of about 30 teenage boys, another local
hoodlum began to dominate and terrorize the kids. This
went on for months until Manu, the smallest among the

fi

fi

fi

714

children, formed a group of six boys. They decided to take
a stand and physically attacked and confronted the bully.
Their courage and uni ed action scared the hoodlum so
much that he never bothered the neighborhood kids again.
These experiences taught Manu valuable lessons about
standing up against injustice, power of working in a group
and dealing with bullies e ectively.
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is
for good men to do nothing." - Edmund Burke This quote
captures the essence of Manu's actions as a child when he
stood up against the neighborhood bully and the hoodlum,
demonstrating that taking a stand is crucial in overcoming
evil.
"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear – not
absence of fear." - Mark Twain Manu's bravery in
confronting the hoodlum and the bully despite his fears
exempli es this sentiment.

Applying the Lessons in Adult Life and
Business
These childhood lessons signi cantly shaped Manu’s
approach to life and business at MSI. The principles of
confronting and addressing wrongdoing were applied to
various aspects of his professional journey. Whether
dealing with dominating and unreasonable customers,
crooked and cheap suppliers, or employees and relatives
who attempted to exploit emotional relationships for
personal gain, Manu knew when to stand rm and take
decisive action.

fi

fi

ff

fi

fi

715

In the business world, Manu encountered situations
where customers tried to dominate or manipulate terms
unreasonably. Drawing from his childhood experiences, he
learned to handle such customers with a rm yet fair
approach, ensuring that MSI's interests were protected
while maintaining ethical business practices. Similarly,
when faced with suppliers who were dishonest or
attempted to cut corners, Manu did not hesitate to sever
ties and nd more reliable partners who shared MSI’s
commitment to quality and integrity.
Here are some of the words Used by Manu at various
times in the long journey.

To a L a r ge re g i o n a l
Customer “let us remain
Friends – No business
going forward”

fi

fi

716

To a Supplier “MSI is not
a good partner to
promote
your
products; please nd a
partner which will
achieve your wishes”

To a Relative or a Friend
“let us keep our great
memories of the time
together and keep
marching each in own
direction”

717
fi

fi

To a valuable employee
when his interest at MSI
change drastically “MSI is
not the right bus where
yo u w a n t t o go ; We
understand and please
nd right bus for your
future journey”

Core Team and others are following and expanding
Manu’s lifelong beliefs.
"Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one
is watching." - C.S. Lewis This quote underscores the
importance of maintaining ethical standards, a principal
Manu adhered to in his business dealings.

Building a Culture of Integrity at MSI
Manu's unwavering stance against unethical behavior
helped build a culture of integrity at MSI. He understood
that allowing even small instances of dishonesty or
exploitation could lead to bigger issues and undermine the
company’s values. By setting clear expectations and
demonstrating the importance of ethical behavior through
his actions, Manu inspired his employees and partners to
adhere to the same high standards.
This approach also extended to how Manu dealt with
internal issues. Employees who engaged in theft or other
dishonest activities were dealt with rmly including
sending them to jail; reinforcing the message that such
behavior would not be tolerated. By confronting these
challenges head-on, Manu ensured that MSI remained a
company where integrity and ethical practices were
paramount, fostering an environment of trust and respect.
In summary, the lessons Manu learned from his
childhood experiences with bullies and blackmailers
became cornerstones of his leadership philosophy. His
ability to confront and address unethical behavior helped
shape MSI into a company known for its integrity and

fi

718

commitment to doing what is right, even when it was
di cult. These principles not only guided MSI’s growth but
also established a legacy of ethical business practices that
continue to in uence the company’s operations today.
"The supreme quality for leadership is
unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is
possible." - Dwight D. Eisenhower This quote highlights
the critical role of integrity in leadership, a cornerstone of
Manu’s approach at MSI.
"Trust is the glue of life. It’s the most essential
ingredient in e ective communication. It’s the
foundational principle that holds all relationships." Stephen R. Covey Manu’s e orts to build a culture of trust
and integrity at MSI are re ected in this quote.

The Concept of Mutually Assured Destruction
Manu was born in June 1945, often referred to as a "peace
baby," as his birth coincided with the end of World War II
and the dawn of a new era marked by the concept of
Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). This principle, which
prevented large-scale con icts by ensuring that any
aggressor would face equal or greater destruction, has kept
major wars at bay since 1945. However, smaller, endless
wars such as the Korean War, Vietnam War, Afghan War,
and now the con ict in Ukraine have shown that while
MAD prevents total war, it does not guarantee peace.
The concept of MAD extends beyond geopolitics into the
business world. Manu applied this understanding to his
business strate y, recognizing that destructive competition

fl

ff

fl

ff

fl

g

fl

ffi

719

—such as undercutting prices meaninglessly, stealing
employees or patents, or sabotaging supply chains—leads to
mutual harm. Just as nations must nd ways to coexist and
compete without triggering catastrophic con ict,
businesses must navigate competition without engaging in
mutually destructive practices.
"An eye for an eye will only make the whole world
blind." - Mahatma Gandhi This quote is a reminder of the
destructive nature of retaliatory actions, relevant to both
geopolitics and business practices.
"The best way to predict the future is to create it." Peter Drucker By focusing on ethical competition and
long-term strategies, Manu aimed to shape a positive future
for MSI.

Practical Applications in Business
Manu’s philosophy was to compete with integrity and
focus on building long-term relationships rather than shortterm gains. For example, rather than engaging in price
wars that could hurt both MSI and its competitors, Manu
focused on di erentiating MSI through quality, customer
service, and innovation. This approach not only protected
MSI's market position but also fostered a more stable and
cooperative industry environment.
Similarly, Manu emphasized the importance of
respecting intellectual property and avoiding practices that
could lead to legal disputes or damage MSI's reputation. By
fostering a culture of innovation and ethical behavior, MSI

fl

fi

ff

720

could compete e ectively without resorting to destructive
tactics.
"In business, the competition will bite you if you
keep running; if you stand still, they will swallow
you." - Victor Kiam This quote re ects the importance of
continuous improvement and ethical competition in
business.
"The price of greatness is responsibility." - Winston
Churchill Manu’s approach to avoiding destructive
competition and fostering positive industry relationships is
encapsulated in this quote.

Personal and Community Relationships
The principle of avoiding mutually assured destruction
also applied to Manu’s personal life and interactions with
neighbors and relatives. He understood that con icts, if not
managed properly, could lead to lasting damage and
disrupt harmony. Manu’s approach was to seek peaceful
resolutions, foster mutual respect, and maintain strong,
positive relationships within his community and extended
family.
"Peace begins with a smile." - Mother Teresa This
quote emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmony
and positive relationships in personal life and community
interactions.
"The greatness of a community is most accurately
measured by the compassionate actions of its
members." - Coretta Scott King Manu’s commitment to

fl

fl

ff

721

peaceful resolutions and strong community ties is
highlighted by this quote.
In summary, the lessons Manu learned from his
childhood experiences with bullies and blackmailers,
combined with his understanding of MAD, became
cornerstones of his leadership philosophy. His ability to
confront and address unethical behavior helped shape MSI
into a company known for its integrity and commitment to
doing what is right, even when it was di cult. These
principles not only guided MSI’s growth but also
established a legacy of ethical business practices that
continue to in uence the company’s operations today.

Health, Near-Death
Experiences, and Lessons
Learned
Manu's life changed after a heart attack in 1999, leading to a
realization about the importance of health and work-life balance.
The near-death experience prompted him to adopt healthier habits
and rethink how MSI could thrive without his constant involvement.
By delegating responsibilities, focusing on succession planning, and
investing in employees and technolo y, Manu built a resilient
organization. His re ections on mortality deepened his commitment
to philanthropy and leaving a legacy that would bene t future
generations.

fi

g

fl

723

anu’s relentless drive and work ethic came at a
cost. In December 1999, during a party, he
experienced chest pain that led to a life-changing
revelation. "I had a chest pain, and my doctor, who was at
the party, advised me to visit the hospital if it got worse,"
Manu recalls. The next day, tests revealed nothing, but his
doctor suspected an issue and scheduled an angioplasty for
the following Tuesday. "Monday night, I had a heart attack,"
Manu says, marking the beginning of a signi cant chapter
in his life.

The First Heart Attack
The heart attack was a turning point. "In the ambulance,
I kept saying to myself, 'I don't want to die,'" Manu
remembers. His thoughts were not just about his family but
also about the thousands of employees depending on MSI.
"What would happen to the 3,000 people we support if
something happened to me?" he pondered. This experience
underscored the responsibility he felt towards his
employees and the broader MSI community.
The severity of his condition led to immediate medical
intervention. Manu underwent a bypass surgery in
February 2000, where ve arteries were bypassed or in
medical terms “quintuple bypass was conducted. However,
in April, he experienced another heart attack. "Four out of
the ve bypasses had failed," Manu recounts. This led to the
placement of multiple stents, a procedure that was
repeated several times over the years. "I now have eight
stents in my body, with six in the same artery," he explains.

fi

724

Lifestyle Changes and Lessons Learned
This near-death experience prompted Manu to
reevaluate his lifestyle. "I realized I had ignored my health
for too long," he admits. Despite his initial reluctance, he
began to incorporate regular exercise and a healthier diet
into his routine. "Exercise not only helps physically but also
releases endorphins that reduce stress," he notes. This
holistic approach to health became an integral part of his
daily life.
Manu also recognized the importance of mental health.
"The stress of managing multiple projects and helping
relatives added to my health issues," he says. Learning to
manage stress became a crucial part of his recovery
process. "Finding a balance between work and personal life
was essential," Manu explains. He credits his wife, Rika, for
her support and encouragement during this challenging
period.

The Broader Perspective
This period of health challenges also gave Manu a
broader perspective on life and business. "I realized the
importance of building a resilient organization that could
thrive even in my absence," he states. This led to a renewed
focus on succession planning and empowering his sons, Raj
and Rup, to take on leadership roles within MSI.
Manu's re ections on mortality have profoundly
in uenced his approach to life and work. "Knowing that life
is fragile makes you appreciate each moment more," he

fl

fl

725

re ects. This awareness has deepened his commitment to
philanthropy and his desire to make a lasting impact. "I
want to ensure that everything I do contributes to a better
world," Manu concludes.

Re ections
The late 1990s and early 2000s were a transformative
period for the healthcare industry, marked by signi cant
advancements in medical technolo y and treatments. The
development of stents, for example, revolutionized the
treatment of coronary artery disease, allowing for less
invasive procedures compared to traditional bypass
surgeries. Manu's multiple stent placements are a testament
to these medical advancements, which have saved
countless lives around the world.
The emphasis on lifestyle changes, particularly the
importance of exercise and stress management, re ects
broader societal shifts towards preventive healthcare. In
the 1990s, the rise of tness culture and increased
awareness of mental health marked a turning point in how
people approached their well-being. Manu's journey
mirrors this cultural shift, highlighting the importance of a
balanced lifestyle in achieving long-term health and
success.
This period also aligns with the broader movement
towards recognizing the importance of mental health.
In uential gures like Arianna Hu ngton, co-founder of
The Hu ngton Post, have emphasized the need for a
holistic approach to well-being. "We need to rede ne
success beyond money and power to include well-being,

fi

fl

fi

ffi

g

fi

fi

ffi

fl

fl

fl

726

wisdom, and our ability to wonder and give," Hu ngton
has said. Manu's experience underscores this philosophy,
illustrating how personal health and professional success
are interconnected.

Building a Resilient Organization
Manu's health crisis prompted him to rethink how MSI
could operate independently of his constant oversight. He
began focusing on creating a resilient organization capable
of thriving without him. This involved empowering his sons
and other key leaders within the company. "Succession
planning became a priority. I wanted to ensure that MSI
could continue its mission even if I were no longer around,"
he states.
The concept of resilience in business is critical, as noted
by Je Bezos, founder of Amazon. "What's dangerous is not
to evolve," Bezos asserts. Manu embraced this mindset,
understanding that adaptability and resilience are crucial
for long-term success. By fostering a culture of resilience,
Manu ensured that MSI could withstand various challenges
and continue to grow.

Investing in People and Technolo y
Manu also recognized the need to invest in both people
and technolo y to build a robust organization. "Our
employees are our greatest asset. We need to ensure they
have the tools and resources to succeed," he explains. This
included ongoing training and development programs, as

ffi

g

g

ff

727

well as investing in new technologies that could streamline
operations and improve e ciency.
The importance of investing in employees is echoed by
Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, who once said,
"We can't achieve our strategic goals without rst investing
in and developing our people." Manu's approach to
building a resilient organization aligns with this principle,
focusing on the growth and development of his team.

Lessons in Leadership
importance of delegating and trusting his team to handle
critical tasks. "I realized I couldn't do everything myself. I
needed to trust my team and delegate responsibilities," he
notes. This shift allowed him to focus on strategic planning
and vision for MSI.
The ability to delegate e ectively is a hallmark of strong
leadership. As Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin
Group, has said, "Train people well enough so they can
leave, treat them well enough so they don’t want to." Manu
embraced this philosophy, ensuring that his team was both
capable and motivated to contribute to MSI's success.

Re ecting on Mortality and Legacy
Manu's near-death experiences have profoundly
in uenced his perspective on life and work. "Facing
mortality made me realize what truly matters. It's not just
about business success, but also about the legacy we leave
behind," he re ects. This realization has deepened his

fi

ffi

ff

fl

fl

fl

728

commitment to philanthropy and ensuring that MSI
continues to make a positive impact on society.
Warren Bu ett, renowned investor and philanthropist,
once said, "Someone is sitting in the shade today because
someone planted a tree a long time ago." Manu's focus on
building a lasting legacy through philanthropy and
education aligns with this sentiment. He is determined to
ensure that his life's work bene ts future generations.

Quotes:
Mahatma Gandhi: "It is health that is real wealth and not
pieces of gold and silver."
Warren Bu ett: "Someone is sitting in the shade today
because someone planted a tree a long time ago."
Arianna Hu ngton: "We need to rede ne success beyond

A New Dawn, One Month
After the Storm
This chapter recounts the pivotal moment on April 8th, 2024,
when Manu Shah faced a life-threatening heart crisis, leading to the
diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia and the implantation of a
heart-ICD. Despite the urgency of the situation, Manu’s resolve to
continue his philanthropic work never wavered. Supported by his
wife, Rika, Manu re ected on his global contributions, including
education and health initiatives, and found renewed determination
to integrate AI into these e orts. Together, they see this challenge as
the beginning of a new chapter, lled with purpose and commitment
to empowering communities worldwide.

Rika and retiring to the bedroom, Manu experienced an
unnerving sensation—his heartbeat felt unnaturally fast and
erratic. Within moments, Rika, his wife and steadfast
partner in both life and philanthropic endeavors, was at his
side. With a presence that was both comforting and
commanding, Rika strapped her Apple Watch onto Manu’s
wrist, which con rmed the grim suspicion: his heart rate
soared above 210 beats per minute with alarming ECG
uctuations. She then dialed their cardiologist and
orchestrated the swift arrival of an ambulance.

fl

n a calm evening of
April 8th, 2024, Manu
Shah, a 78+ year-old
distinguished entrepreneur
and philanthropist,
encountered a crisis that tested
his resilience like never before.
The founder of MS
International and Sava Mangal
Family Trust, Manu had spent
his life turning visionary ideas
into tangible realities and
aiding countless lives around
the globe. Yet, his own heart, a
survivor of two previous heart
attacks and forti ed by 8 stents and ve grafts, posed a
sudden and dramatic challenge.

As they raced towards the hospital, Manu’s mind,
typically a hub of strategic planning and hopeful
aspirations, was clouded with uncertainty and fear. Yet, in
this whirlwind of emotions, his resolve hardened. “I am not
ready to die. My work is not done. There are still so many I
can help, so many changes I can make,” he thought
determinedly.

767

Upon reaching the hospital, Manu was quickly
surrounded by a team of doctors in the emergency room.
His two sons arrived, worry etched on their faces but also
showing a erce determination to support their father. The
initial blood tests surprisingly indicated no new heart
attack, shifting the doctors’ concerns towards ventricular
tachycardia—a heart rhythm disorder stemming likely from
scar tissue a ecting the lower chambers of his heart.
Further examinations, including an angiogram conducted
the next day, revealed no blockages, leading to the decision
to implant a Heart-ICD. This device would not only pace but
also harmonize the rhythm between the upper and lower
chambers of his heart, a critical step in preventing future
episodes.
In the tense 30 seconds following his initial symptoms,
and throughout the subsequent 30 minutes as he lay in the
ambulance, Manu's mind was a whirlwind of past
achievements and future commitments. He re ected on his
ongoing projects and the global impact of his work. From
early childhood development programs for children aged 6
months to 6 years, to educational initiatives for those aged
6 to 16, and vocational training for high school students—his
vision was expansive. His plans also encompassed health
and nutritional interventions for girls and women in
developing countries, including initiatives to improve
hemoglobin levels and provide essential vision screenings
and eyeglasses to millions.
Now, recovering with a newly implanted ICD, Manu felt a
profound sense of urgency and clarity. The experience had
not only been a brush with mortality but also a poignant

fl

reminder of the impermanence of life and the vast needs of
the world. With Rika, his partner in every sense, by his
side, Manu is poised to resume his journey with even
greater vigor. Together, they are a formidable force, driven
by a shared passion for making a di erence and
empowered by a deep personal connection that had
sustained them through decades of challenges and
achievements.
Beyond his existing ventures, Manu’s passion for
technolo y and his excitement about the potential of
arti cial intelligence injected a new ener y into his
thoughts. He envisioned integrating AI to revolutionize
educational platforms, making learning more accessible
and tailored to individual needs across the globe. His mind
buzzed with ideas of AI-driven health diagnostics that could
dramatically improve healthcare delivery in remote areas.
Manu Shah is more than
just a survivor; he is a
beacon of hope and a
catalyst for change. As
he contemplated his
next steps, his heart—
both the physical and
the metaphorical source
of his life’s blood—is very
strong, steady, and ready to support the continued journey
of impacting lives across the globe. The story of Manu and
Rika Shah is far from over; in many ways, a new chapter is
just beginning, fueled by love, commitment, and an
unwavering desire to enrich and empower the human
community.

Passions & Pastimes of
Manu and Rika Shah - Manu
Shah – A Lifelong Student,
Innovator, and Visionary
Manu Shah’s entire life is marked by an unrelenting quest for
knowledge. His journey from India to the United States, lled with
trials and triumphs, laid the groundwork for his personal
philosophy: learning never stops. Whether it’s from books,
conversations, or life experiences, Manu’s passion for
understanding the world and its mechanics has shaped his
trajectory as an entrepreneur.

fi

803

anu’s inquisitive
nature has been
the engine behind MSI’s
innovation. His love for
history and geography
fueled his understanding
of how global dynamics
impact local markets. His
belief is simple but
profound: innovation is
born from curiosity. At
MSI, Manu spearheaded early technolo y adoption, from
computers and fax machines to cutting-edge AI tools. He
has consistently found ways to integrate technolo y into
day-to-day operations, ensuring MSI’s growth. He remarks,
"Innovation is the lifeblood of any successful business. It
keeps us relevant in a rapidly changing world" .
Manu’s approach to challenges was never about asking,
“Why me?” but “What next?” This mindset enabled him to
embrace challenges as opportunities. His lifelong dream of
using technolo y to create jobs in rural areas and improve
quality of life re ects his commitment to applying his
knowledge for the greater good. From early adoption of
mobile phones and augmented reality to AI-driven tools,
Manu has always envisioned technolo y as an enabler for
both business and social impact.

804

Geography and History Enthusiast
Manu's love for geography and history stems from a
f a s c i n a t i o n w i t h t h e wo rl d’s v a s t n e s s a n d t h e
interconnectivity of human civilizations. He often
emphasizes how geographical changes shape the destinies
of nations and businesses alike. This passion allowed him to
see beyond borders when growing MSI, understanding that
every market, no matter how distant, presented a new
opportunity. His appreciation for history helped him
predict market changes and respond to them with agility,
always seeing the bigger picture in both business and life.

Never Complaining, Always Dreaming
The hallmark of Manu’s success is his refusal to
complain. No matter the circumstances, he believed in
using what was available to him and making the most of it.
"Dreaming big," as Manu calls it, is not just about imagining
success but actively working toward it. Whether it was
building MSI with limited resources in the 1970s or
integrating digital tools in the 2000s, Manu’s approach has
always been rooted in optimism and a drive to improve. His
ability to create jobs and opportunities in rural
communities demonstrates his commitment to uplifting
those who are often overlooked.

805

Philanthropy – Serving the Bottom of the
Pyramid
Manu’s philanthropic journey is driven by a belief in
using technolo y to address pressing global issues. From
non-invasive mass screenings for anemia to providing
millions of eyeglasses, his focus has always been on
leveraging the latest innovations to reach the world’s most
underserved populations. Through the Sarva Mangal
Family Trust, Manu has applied this philosophy to early
childhood development initiatives and healthcare
programs. His belief in being a catalyst for change is
evident in every charitable e ort. Manu and Rika have
dedicated their lives to improving the lives of others. They
believe in giving not just money, but time, attention, and
love, ensuring that their contributions create meaningful
change.

Love for Travel and Exploration
Another of Manu’s lifelong passions is travel. Not just for
leisure, but to immerse himself in new cultures and
experiences. He has traveled to all 50 states in the USA and
visited 62 other countries, learning from every destination.
To Manu, each place o ers a new lesson, whether in
business, history, or human nature. This global perspective
has played a signi cant role in shaping his business
strategies and expanding MSI’s reach into new markets. His
travels have strengthened his belief that the world is
interconnected and that geography and culture in uence
both people and economies.

806

Never Ready to Retire
At 79, Manu shows no signs of slowing down. His mind is
always active, whether planning the next innovation for
MSI or pondering the lessons from his favorite books.
Retirement has never appealed to him; instead, he views
every day as another opportunity to learn, grow, and
contribute to the world.

Rika Shah – A Teacher, Nurturer, and Advocate
for Simplicity
While Manu’s journey has been driven by curiosity and
innovation, Rika Shah’s has been marked by her devotion
to teaching, nurturing, and simplicity. A lifelong teacher,
Rika’s passion for education never waned. Even after
leaving her formal teaching career to support Manu in
building MSI, she continued to share her love of learning
with her children and community.

A Love for Vegetarian Cooking
Rika’s passion for vegetarian
cooking goes beyond
preparing meals; it’s about
providing nourishment for
both body and soul. Her
meals are a re ection of her
love for simplicit y and
giving. Whether cooking for
her family or feeding anyone
in need, Rika’s philosophy

fl

807

has always been that food is a form of care. Her meals are
simple, yet deeply nourishing, echoing her broader
approach to life – where less is often more.

Empowerment Through Simplicity and
Nurturing
Rika’s philosophy of empowerment starts with providing
opportunities for women at the bottom of society. Her work
in de-addiction programs, particularly in helping women
quit smoking and tobacco use, is a testament to her
commitment to uplifting others. She believes that by
helping women free themselves from these addictions, they
can begin to lead healthier, more empowered lives. This
focus on women’s empowerment is another re ection of
her lifelong commitment to nurturing and teaching,
helping those who need it most to nd their strength.

A Love for Meeting People and Historical
Places
Rika enjoys meeting people from all walks of life, a
passion she shares with Manu. However, her love for
historical places, especially those with cultural signi cance,
highlights her deep appreciation for history and tradition.
But above all, **her two daughters-in-law and ve
grandchildren** are her greatest joy. Rika’s love for family is
evident in everything she does, and her role as a
grandmother is one she treasures most.

808

Shared Values: Humility and Generosity
Together, Manu and Rika Shah exemplify humility and a
deep commitment to giving back. Despite the success they
have achieved, both remain grounded in their roots, always
ready to o er help where it is needed. Their pride in their
extended family, employees, and suppliers is palpable. To
them, success is not just measured by the growth of MSI,
but by the positive impact they have had on their
community. Whether it’s helping employees or reaching
out to distant family members, Manu and Rika’s generosity
knows no bounds.

Proud of Family and Employees
Manu and Rika Shah's
p r i d e i n t h e i r f a m i ly,
particularly their two sons,
Raj and Rup, who now lead
MSI, shines through in
every word and action.
This sense of pride extends
beyond their immediate
family to the thousands of
MSI employees and the
partners and suppliers who
have been part of their
journey. For the Shahs, these relationships stand as a
powerful testament to the strength of their values and the
sense of family they’ve cultivated both at home and within
their company. For Manu and Rika, the success of MSI is

ff

809

not just measured in business terms but in the relationships
they’ve built and the lives they’ve touched.

Humility in Leadership
Despite being at the helm of one of the largest stone and
tile distributors in North America, Manu and Rika maintain
an extraordinary level of humility. Their leadership is
de ned not by titles or accolades, but by their unwavering
commitment to the people they serve—employees,
suppliers, customers, and bene ciaries of their
philanthropic e orts. They remain as focused on giving
back as they are on growing their business.

Conclusion
The passions and pastimes of Manu and Rika Shah go
beyond the typical de nitions of success and ful llment.
For Manu, success lies in lifelong learning, curiosity, and
innovation. For Rika, it is rooted in nurturing, teaching,
and simplicity. Together, they have not only built a global
business empire but also left an indelible mark on the
world through their philanthropic e orts. Humble,
generous, and deeply committed to those around them,
Manu and Rika’s story serves as an inspiring example of
how passion, purpose, and hard work can create lasting
change.
Their legacy is not just one of business success but of
lives touched and transformed.

Incorporating quotes and placing Manu and Rika Shah’s
journey within a broader historical, technological, and
cultural context can help deepen the meaning of their
achievements and philosophies. Here are some relevant
quotes and contexts to consider:

Historical and Technological Context
Manu Shah’s love for innovation and curiosity aligns
with the technological revolutions he lived through. His
early adoption of computers, digital tools, and AI mirrors
the trajectory of global advancements.
1. Quote on Innovation and Curiosity
“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a
follower.” — Steve Jobs
This quote re ects Manu’s leadership style. He wasn’t just
following trends; he was often ahead of them, adopting
technologies like digital cameras and AI long before others
in his industry.
2. Historical Context
Manu arrived in America in the 1960s, during a period of
rapid technological advancements. From the moon landing
to the birth of the personal computer, Manu witnessed and
embraced the monumental shifts in technolo y. He was
among the early adopters of computers in business, as seen
with his use of IBM cards and later desktop computers like
NorthStar in the 1970s. This was a time when businesses
were only beginning to understand how technolo y could
streamline operations and expand reach.

g

fl

811

3. Quote on Lifelong Learning:
“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you
were to live forever.” — Mahatma Gandhi
This resonates deeply with Manu’s belief in continuous
learning. His journey as a lifelong student, from mastering
spreadsheets to utilizing AI in his business, embodies the
philosophy of constant self-improvement.
4. Technological Milestones:
Manu’s integration of technolo y within MSI—from fax
machines and mobile phones to AI—echoes the **Fourth
Industrial Revolution**, where digital, physical, and
biological worlds began to converge. His foresight in using
augmented reality and AI to improve operational e ciency
places him among visionary leaders who embraced digital
transformation before it became mainstream.

Cultural and Philanthropic Context
Rika Shah’s simple and giving nature is deeply rooted in
cultural values and her approach to empowerment. Her
e orts to feed, teach, and uplift others, especially women
from marginalized communities, highlight her belief in
personal responsibility and service.
1. Quote on Simplicity and Giving
“The best way to nd yourself is to lose yourself in the
service of others.” — Mahatma Gandhi
Rika’s life re ects this belief. From cooking for anyone who
needs a meal to empowering women through de-addiction

ffi

g

fi

fl

ff

812

and economic independence, her service has always been
at the heart of her actions.
2. Cultural Context:
Both Manu and Rika come from a tradition of Seva (sel ess
service), a cornerstone of Indian culture. Their approach
to philanthropy—whether it’s screening for anemia,
providing eyeglasses, or championing early childhood
development—re ects the Indian values of giving back to
the community, especially the most underserved. Their
support of Akshayapatra, an organization providing midday meals to schoolchildren, mirrors India’s ancient
practice of Annapurna (food as sustenance for all), which
their mothers embodied.
3. Quote on Women’s Empowerment:
“When women are empowered, they immeasurably
improve the lives of everyone around them—their families,
their communities, and their countries.” — Prince Harry
Rika’s e orts in supporting women’s deaddiction and
empowering them nancially echoes this sentiment. Her
focus on the most marginalized women demonstrates her
belief in creating change from the ground up.
4. Philanthropic Milestones:
Manu and Rika’s philanthropic philosophy can be aligned
with Peter Drucker’s idea of “the social responsibility of
business” —not just creating pro ts, but actively
contributing to the welfare of society. Their mass screening
initiatives and early childhood development projects
underscore the role of businesses as social changemakers.

813

Broader Context of Humility and Success
Manu and Rika’s shared humility and readiness to help
others underscore their leadership style, which is less
about seeking recognition and more about making a
genuine impact.
1. Quote on Humility and Success:
“True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is
thinking of yourself less.” — C.S. Lewis
This perfectly captures the spirit of both Manu and Rika,
whose focus has always been on their family, their
employees, and the communities they serve, rather than on
their own accolades.
2. Cultural Context on Family and Community:
Indian culture places a great emphasis on the extended
family, including both blood relatives and those connected
through business and community. For Manu and Rika, their
employees and suppliers are part of this extended family.
Their sense of Dharma (duty) drives their responsibility to
take care of these relationships, which explains why MSI
has a no-layo policy even during challenging economic
times.

“The Life & Times of Manu Shah is woven with professional

These historical events are not just Shah family history but
it is now the history of a much larger family, everyone at

- Lokesh Mehta, Senior Vice President, MSIS
"Having had the privilege of being associated with Manu
and MSI, I found reading his autobiography to be an eyeopener. I thought I knew him well, but I discovered so
much more—valuable life lessons and experiences that
provided profound insight. As an immigrant parent, his
stories about raising children, including the counter will
instinct, encouraging independence, and fostering
contentment and acceptance, resonated deeply with me.
Working alongside him as a team member has been a
privilege, allowing me to experience rsthand what true
leadership looks like. His lessons on leadership versus
management and the importance of giving credit rather
than assigning blame are invaluable takeaways for any
aspiring young leader.
One of the most memorable
statements from his book is, 'Someone is sitting in the
shade today because someone planted a tree a long time
ago.' This quote holds so much depth and meaning. The
strategic insights he shares through his life examples make
this an incredibly motivational read. His journey, lled with
real-life wisdom and understanding of what truly matters,
has made this book a delightful experience. There are few
books that leave a lasting imprint, and this will
undoubtedly be one of them for me."
